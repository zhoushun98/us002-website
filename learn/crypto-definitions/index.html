<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>ASICs, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, have been specially designed to make it easier to mine specific cryptocurrencies. However, since ASICs are expensive, this brings about a level of centralization to crypto mining – something that some crypto enthusiasts find to be against the principles of crypto. With this in mind, some blockchains have been designed so that ASIC mining has no particular advantage over mining with regular equipment (GPUs).</p>

Compare with Adam and Eve double top. See also double bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The pattern starts with a steep decline in price, forming the first bottom where the price bounces hard and fast, forming a 'V' shape. This bottom is called Adam. After a price rebound and some upward movement, the price eventually starts declining again, this time at a slower pace. As it nears the levels of the previously formed bottom (Adam), the price is rejected from falling lower. A second, longer-lasting and thus wider bottom is formed as a 'U' shape. This bottom is called Eve. After the second bottom is formed, the price is expected to start rising.</p>

Compare with Adam and Eve double bottom. See also double top.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Adam and Eve double top starts with a price surge, forming the first top (Adam), which is narrow and pointed, with a strong price rejection at the peak. It forms the shape of an inverted 'V'. After this first top and the following sell-off, the price picks up and starts forming the second top (Eve). The shape of Eve is rounder and wider than that of Adam. It is common that the price does not reach the same heights as the first top, thus forming a lower high. After Eve is formed, the price is expected to start declining.</p>

Compare with descending triangle and symmetric triangle.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The ascending triangle is formed when consistent higher lows are formed, with a horizontal resistance level above. This is the most bullish among all bilateral chart patterns, as it signals increased buying pressure, and it usually forms in a bull trend. When the ascending triangle is concluded, a bullish price breakout is expected, however in a bearish market this pattern can result in a sell off.</p>

Also known as 'public-key cryptography'. Compare with symmetric cryptography.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Unlike symmetric cryptography, where a universal key is used, in asymmetric cryptography each user gets a unique public key and its corresponding private key. Messages are encrypted using public keys and decrypted using private keys, thus avoiding the risk of exposing the whole system if they leak. Messages are also signed with a private key and verified with a public key – the verification proves that the creator of the signature owns the private key that has been used to create the signature. Asymmetric cryptography is used by blockchains to ensure a safe and transparent transaction environment.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Much like HODL is a distortion of 'hold', BUIDL is a distortion of 'build'. However, whole HOLD came to be by chance (mistyping) and then caught on, BUIDL was created intentionally as a response to both the term and the idea of HODL. As opposed to a HODLer, a BUIDLer believes that simply holding crypto assets is not enough to drive the technology forwards and that a greater level of participation in the crypto community (be it by developing, testing or otherwise contributing) is necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The bear flag pattern forms in two stages. First, a sudden decrease in price happens, forming a bearish flagpole. The bigger the price drop, the more bearish the pattern. Second, a flag is formed, representing a slow price correction in an ascending trading channel. At the end of the flag, the price is expected to continue falling.</p>

Sometimes just 'bear'.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Bears use techniques such as short selling in an attempt to make profit from a market where prices are believed to start falling. They sell assets when prices are high and then wait for an opportunity to make a cheap purchase once they have fallen. Bears usually generate profit by borrowing assets when market prices are about to fall, then selling and re-purchasing when more affordable, before ultimately returning them.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Investors in a falling market begin to drop out in an attempt to cash in any profits, sending the market into an even steeper drop. Bear investors attempt to predict market falls and profit from them. The name comes from the way a bear attacks its prey by swiping its paws downwards. Traditional bear markets (stocks and real estate) go hand in hand with a slow and sluggish economy, high unemployment rates and unwelcome changes in taxation. However, no confirmed correlation has yet been established between these factors and crypto markets.</p>

Compare with bullish three-line strike.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A bearish three-line strike starts with three persuasive bearish candles (as with the three black crows pattern), followed by a long bullish candle which closes around the opening price of the first candlestick. This pattern usually signifies a bearish continuation, meaning that after the last candle the bears step in again and continue to push the price lower. In a bull market, this pattern could signal a trend reversal, meaning that there is no continuation of a bearish sell-off after the fourth candle.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Bid-ask spreads can be thought of as the difference between the lowest ask and the highest bid in the order book of an exchange. They usually occur on traditional markets as a means of monetizing the services of a broker. However, on crypto exchanges, bid-ask spreads occur as a consequence of the trade orders being placed directly in the order book, and the exchange doesn't monetize them (they usually charge transaction fees instead).</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Bilateral chart patterns are considered indecisive, meaning that they do not predict a clear-cut trend continuation or reversal. As such, bilateral patterns do not present an ideal trade entry or exit points and other factors should be taken into consideration when trading these patterns. Common bilateral chart patterns include rectangles, ascending triangles, descending triangles and symmetrical triangles.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash operates with bigger blocks than Bitcoin in order to resolve bottlenecking issues that prevent a smooth flow of transactions. The philosophy behind this cryptocurrency is that scaling can be achieved by periodic increases in block size (which has currently grown to 32 MB). Bigger blocks can fit more transaction data, but make Bitcoin Cash more power-hungry than its older brother. In order to achieve block size increases, Bitcoin Cash keeps undergoing scheduled forks.</p>

Blocks can store simple transaction data (Bitcoin) or more complex software code (Ethereum).</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Data stored on a blockchain is fragmented and stored in blocks. Alongside transaction data itself, blocks also contain metadata (usually stored in the block header). Blocks are arranged in a temporal order, from oldest to newest. From blockchain to blockchain they vary in size and the frequency of creation (see block size and block time). Adding a new block means collecting data and sealing it by cryptographic means. Commonly, proof of work is used to ensure the legitimacy of each block, but there are also several alternatives. After a block is added to the blockchain, it is virtually impossible to change.</p>
</div></article><article id="block-explorer" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Block Explorer</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>A webpage that displays information on the blocks, transactions, address balances etc. of a specific blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Block explorers are an easy way to gather information on a blockchain, allowing anyone to check the blocks, transactions, address balances and other information on the blockchain that is publicly available. Note that some blockchains don't share such data, limiting the usefulness of block explorers for private blockchains.</p>
<p>Block explorers are not distributed or trustless, but controlled by an authority, so there is no guarantee that they show correct information.</p>

Not to be confused with transaction gas limit.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Block gas limit determines how much gas can fit into each block. Since not all transactions are the same, plenty of transactions or a few very complex ones can represent the same amount of computational work and, consequently, gas.</p>
<p>This not a hard limit. With each block, the miners can vote to increase or decrease the gas limit by a factor of 1/1024 or approximately 0.0975%.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The block header serves as a means to identify and position the block within the blockchain.</p>
<p>In the case of Bitcoin and similar blockchains, the block header contains the version number of the block, its timestamp, the hash of the previous block, the hash of the Merkle Root, the nonce, and the target hash of the block.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Mining blocks is an essential process for most cryptocurrencies, but since it can take a lot of computing power, miners need an incentive to participate. In order to repay the miners for their work, a certain amount of coins or tokens is offered as the reward to the first person who manages to perform all the calculations required to seal a block.</p>
<p>Block rewards can be rather substantial, making mining a very competitive space. Bitcoin's current reward is 6.25 coins.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Each blockchain's consensus rules determine the maximum size of blocks. This is done to keep a steady production of regular blocks.</p>
</div></article><article id="block-time" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Block Time</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>The average time it takes for miners to seal off a block. It is based on an algorithm which determines mining difficulty based on available hashing power.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Block time is set to a specific predetermined value decided by the blockchain's creators. An algorithm adapts the difficulty of mining according to the computing power on the network, so that the actual time it takes to mine a block is roughly equal to the block time. This results in the actual block time being close to, but not precisely at the set value. Therefore, we often speak about 'average block times'.</p>
<p>The block time of Bitcoin is around 10 minutes, Litecoin is 2.5 minutes, and Ethereum sits at approximately 12 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A blockchain is a temporally ordered set of blocks usually containing transaction data of a cryptocurrency and distributed throughout a network. Each user (or node) holds their own copy of the blockchain, to which new blocks are added when mined and validated by the blockchain network.</p>
<p>Because independent nodes replace centralized servers, blockchains are said to be decentralized.</p>
<p>It is virtually impossible to tamper with the data in a blockchain, since this would require the majority of nodes on the network to be overthrown.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Blockchain presents an alternative to storing data at a single service provider (on a server, cloud or in a bank).</p>
<p>It works by creating a network of nodes, where each node gets a copy of the whole database. The nodes validate transactions among themselves, eliminating the need for a trusted third party.</p>
<p>Blockchain has been popularized by Satoshi Nakamoto, who used it as the backbone for his cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>If someone wants to transfer cryptocurrency to you, they need to send it to your blockchain address.</p>
<p>All user addresses on a blockchain are visible to everyone but the identities of the people behind the addresses are hidden.</p>
<p>On blockchains such as Bitcoin's, the address is usually represented by 34-character-long string hashed from the public key. It contains letters and numbers, but some characters are limited to prevent ambiguity (upper case 'O' and zero '0', for instance).</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Consensus rules determine various parameters (such as that the same coins cannot be spent twice). If a new transaction fails to meet those parameters, the nodes will reject it.</p>
<p>Consensus rules achieve consistency and agreement between nodes. They determine the validity of every block and transaction, and define the basic properties of the blockchain.</p>
<p>The community usually decides upon what the consensus rules are (private blockchains are a different matter).</p>
<p>The rules are enforced by the client and upheld by full nodes. Actors that fail to adhere to the rules are banned from the network.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Blockchains have been experiencing a remarkable growth in the number of their users. The more the users are, the greater the number of transactions. In order for the network to be able to handle the stress, blockchains need to adapt to be able to process these transactions faster and without delay or any issues.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Bollinger bands consist of a moving average in the middle and two trading bands on the sides, one running above and one below the moving average. The moving average follows the price movement with some delay, while the trading bands behave a bit differently. When the market is not experiencing much volatility, the trading bands move close to each other. As the channel formed by the trading bands tightens, the chance that a price movement will occur becomes imminent. When the price makes a significant move, the trading bands move in opposite directions, away from the moving average, forming a broad channel. The moving average of the Bollinger Bands represents a support level (when price is above it) or a resistance level (when price is below it). Bollinger bands were developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>To break even means that all the expenses of an investment have been covered, with there being no loss (or profit) at this point if the investment were to be sold.</p>
<p>The point at which one breaks even is known as the break-even point (or BEP). To calculate this point, the break-even multiple is used.</p>

Sometimes spelt 'breakeven multiple'.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The break-even multiple is calculated by dividing the buying price by the current market price. A multiple larger than 1 means the value of the investment has to grow in order to reach the BEP (break-even point), a value smaller than 1 means the investment will yield a profit if sold.</p>
<p>If you invested in a coin whose market price was 100 USD, but has since fallen to 50 USD, you would need the price to double (multiple of 2) in order to reach the BEP. If the price grew to 120 USD (multiple of 0.83), you're in the money.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Reaching the break-even point means covering all the expenses of an investment with no profit or loss if the investment is sold. After this point, any additional growth of the investment's price results in profits.</p>

Compare with bearish three-line strike.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A bullish three-line strike forms with three strong bullish candles (similar to the three white soldiers pattern), followed by a long bearish candle, which closes around the opening price of the first candle in the pattern. In a bull market, this is a continuation pattern, although it might not seem obvious at first glance. The bearish candle at the end of the pattern only signifies profit-taking from the bulls, meaning that the bulls are willing to rebuy after the bearish candle, which results in the continuation of a bull trend. Sometimes in a bear market, or if a bullish market is generally weakening, this pattern can also play out as a reversal pattern, meaning that the fourth – bearish – candle is actually a reversal candle that puts the bullish price uprise to an end.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Candlestick patterns can signify either a trend reversal (meaning that the price trend will change direction) or a trend continuation (where the trend goes on). Bullish candlestick patterns predict an uptrend. Some of the most known bullish candlestick patterns are bullish engulfing, three inside up and &nbsp;morning star. Conversely, bearish candlestick patterns predict a downtrend. Some of the most known bearish candlestick patterns include bearish engulfing, three inside down and evening star.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>During capitulation, investors want to sell their holdings as fast as possible. The increase in supply through the soaring number of sell orders has a detrimental effect on the price of the asset. Capitulation is accompanied by panic and despair and sees investors give up on any gains and even accept losses if unavoidable.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A central ledger works by multiple people entrusting a third party (like a bank) to keep records of transactions between them.</p>
<p>If Peter owes Linda two coins, the bank has taken note of that in its central ledger, and Peter will be expected to pay out. Even if Peter doesn't want to pay, he's obligated to do so by the bank.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>When we talk about centralized currencies, we usually refer to fiat currencies such as the United States Dollar or the Euro. However, even digital currencies can be centralized. Before Bitcoin hit the market, every form of digital money in existence was centralized. Blockchain technology allowed the development of decentralized currencies, but blockchains can also be private and thus controlled by a central authority.</p>

As the price moves within the channel it is expected to rebound from these support and resistance levels.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>There are three different types of channels depending on the price trend. An ascending channel is bordered by ascending support and resistance lines, and predicts the continuation of an uptrend. A descending channel is bordered by descending trendlines and predicts a downtrend. When the price runs flat for a while, it is trapped in a horizontal channel, bordered by horizontal lines. A horizontal channel is also known as a range. If a price breaks below support or above resistance level this is called a breakout.</p>

Compare with candlestick patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing and utilizing chart patterns is essential for traders in any market. Specific chart patterns forecast a bullish or bearish market and can signify a trend continuation or a trend reversal. Chart patterns are split into three categories: continuation chart patterns (price trend continues), reversal chart patterns (price trend changes direction) and bilateral chart patterns (price trend can move either way). When trading based on these patterns, volume plays an important role, as a price breakout (either up or down) at the end of a pattern should be accompanied by an increased trading volume for the pattern to be confirmed.</p>

</div></article><article id="cold-storage" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Cold Storage</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>A means of storing your cryptocurrency offline. Often considered the safest way of storing crypto assets.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Physical separation from the internet forms a layer of protection for the contents of the wallet, as it reduces the risk of hacking and unauthorized access. Cold storage holds the user's private key, not the units of currency itself. Cold storage is achieved through printing (or writing) private keys on paper or with hardware ledgers, which are devices similar to USB flash drives, but for storing cryptocurrency.</p>
</div></article><article id="cold-wallet" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Cold Wallet</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d>→ <a href="#cold-storage">Cold Storage</a></div></article><article id="confirmation" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Confirmation</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>The process confirming a transaction by including it in a block and adding further blocks on top of it to satisfy demands for legitimacy and finality. Usually counted in blocks, e.g. 'three confirmations'.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A transaction gains its first confirmation when it is written into the newest block of the blockchain. Every block added after that is considered an additional confirmation, showing that the transaction is legitimate. A merchant accepting crypto as payment can set their own threshold for how deep a transaction needs to be in order to be considered final. If a merchant asks for 6 confirmations before accepting a transaction, that means 5 blocks need to be added to the chain after the block with the original transaction. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it is to change with a double-spending attack.</p>
</div></article><article id="confirmation-time" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Confirmation Time</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>The times it takes for a crypto transaction to be added to a block.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A crypto transaction first needs to be signed and distributed to the network. Then, it is collected by the miners from the mempool (too low an attached fee could leave it stuck there) and added to a valid block. This process can take anything from a couple of seconds to several minutes, depending on the blockchain, current traffic and the fee attached to your transaction. Some merchants and exchanges will only consider a transaction confirmed after it has reached a level of depth in the blockchain that guarantees practical finality. The general consensus is that this takes around 1 hour when it comes to Bitcoin (6 confirmations).</p>

Compare with externally owned account.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Contract accounts can hold a balance of ether, ERC-20 tokens, tokens of a different standard or even none at all. Unlike externally owned accounts, contracts accounts represent the address of a smart contract. This means that there is no private key that would allow the owner of the account to spend the coins held at the contract account’s address. Instead, code execution is triggered by transactions or messages (i.e. calls). Whenever executed, a contract account performs various operations of arbitrary complexity. A contract account can manipulate its persistent storage, which means it can have its own permanent state. It is also able to call other contracts.</p>

<p>The crowdsale takes place after the private sale and the presale. During the crowdsale, almost everyone is welcome to invest in the ICO, but the investors may need to be whitelisted and can be required to fill in and submit a KYC form. This is necessary to comply with regulations (such as AML policies and anti-terrorist prevention measures). The crowdsale is sometimes limited to a country, state or another regulatory jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional centralized currencies, many (but not all) cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning that no single individual or institution controls their supply and transfer. The decision making lies solely in the hands of the users. The name comes from their dependence on cryptography to secure the transactions.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The cup and handle pattern consists of a U-shaped cup, followed by a slight price move downward – the handle. As the cup starts forming, the trading volume should decrease as it reaches the bottom of the cup, signifying reduced selling pressure. When the cup starts rounding upwards, the trading volume should increase, which means there is more interest in higher prices. When the cup is fully formed, a slight decline in price happens – the handle. After this correction, the price is usually expected to rebound and continue climbing higher.</p>

<p>The most widely respected and traded death cross occurs when a 50-period moving average crosses below the 200-period moving average. It is most commonly observed on a 1-day candlestick timeframe, however it can happen on any timeframe. Before a death cross takes place on a chart, the price has to reach a peak first, followed by downward price movement (trend reversal). As the price fails to pick up and starts increasing again, a death cross appears on the chart, which results in a breakout to the downside, followed by a downtrend continuation.</p>

<p>DApps are applications based on blockchain technology. They store data cryptographically and often generate their own tokens. Just like traditional apps, DApps can have numerous uses and functions. They get their name from the way they host and distribute data: rather than at a central server, DApps run on a decentralized blockchain network of nodes. Decentralized applications were first introduced by the Ethereum platform.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>During a period of deflation, the value of money grows, meaning that you can purchase more for less money (the opposite is true for inflation). Strictly speaking, deflation only happens when there is a need for money on the market, and should not be confused with price deflation, which still means everything costs less, but this time because there is a decrease in price of products or services.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>In delegated proof of stake, token holders vote to elect delegates who will do the validation on their behalf. If a delegate fails to deliver a block or validates invalid transactions, they are replaced by a newly elected delegate. Validators don't compete for the next block. Instead, they collaborate. Delegated proof of stake is highly energy efficient, but it is centralized to some extent.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Derivatives are a family of financial contracts that have their value based on another type of financial product, such as stocks or cryptocurrencies. Derivatives can specify various terms: what, for which price and when something will be bought or sold, and the conditions under which that will happen, to name a few. Common types of derivatives include futures and options.</p>

<p>The descending triangle is the most bearish of all bilateral chart patterns and it usually forms during a bear trend. It is formed when a price is reaching ever lower highs, with a horizontal support below. The pattern shows increased selling pressure at an ever lower price. It is expected that a bearish sell-off happens at the end of the pattern, however in a bullish market this pattern can result in a bullish breakout.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Dictionary attacks are essentially brute-force attacks, with the twist that they go through the possible combinations in a pre-defined order. This order is determined by which inputs are most likely to unlock the system. They verge from common and proper names, birthdays and other dates, to simply words found in a dictionary. As a demonstration, consider that the most common passwords include 'password', '1234' and 'user'. So naturally, starting your attack with inputs such as these makes most sense.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>As a way to ensure that the produced blocks are legitimate, proof-of-work blockchains demand that there is a certain difficulty in producing them. The difficulty translates into a substantial resource demand for mining new blocks, meaning that anyone who tackles the mining job will want to uphold the system, as the mining rewards and fees obtained from it represent their direct compensation for the investment (i.e. mining equipment and facilities, as well as electricity consumed in mining). Difficulty adapts based on the hash rate – an increase in hashing power causes an increase in difficulty and vice versa. Specifically, this means a certain portion of the block header hash needs to display a particular value (the first n characters need to be zero), which is achieved by trying out different nonces.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The Elliott wave theory predicts that the market moves in eight distinctive waves. The first five waves are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, while the last three waves are labeled A, B, C. This is called a 5-3 move, where the number 5 represents the first 5 waves, and the number 3 represents the last 3 waves. Waves number 1, 3 and 5 are aligned with the general direction of the market trend, while waves number 2 and 4 represent a slight pullback from waves 1 and 3. When the peak (or bottom) is reached at wave number 5, the A, B, C waves represent a bigger price correction. Waves A and C represent a price movement in the direction of the price correction, while wave B represents a slight price pullback from wave A. The theory was developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the 1930s.</p>

However, when a fakeout takes place, the movement doesn't develop in the anticipated way and the price moves in the opposite direction. To increase the chances of successfully avoiding fakeouts, traders resort to using a variety of technical indicators and chart patterns simultaneously, chief among them being volume. Price changes accompanied by low trading volume are considered to be weak and often result in a fakeout.</p>

<p>Transactions of cryptocurrencies have to be packed into blocks by the miners in the network. Since mining requires a great deal of computing power and can be time-consuming, miners need to be incentivized to write your transaction in the newest block. One way their work can be compensated is by offering a small percentage of your transaction to the miner to add it into the block. Another way of incentivizing miners is the block reward.</p>

<p>Fill-or-kill orders require your transaction to be executed exactly at the specified price. The order is most commonly used for large quantities. Sometimes a FOK order will allow as many tokens to be purchased as are available at the specified price, then cancel the rest. The benefits of a fill-or-kill order are no partial delivery of assets and immediate execution. However, if the order book doesn't hold enough units to fill your order, the order will be cancelled.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Information in a blockchain (namely crypto transactions) cannot be changed once it reaches the state of finality. To be precise, true finality is impossible to achieve. Therefore, finality usually refers to practical finality, a point beyond which it is infeasible (practically impossible) to alter information in a blockchain. Merchants and exchanges alike achieve a degree of protection by requiring a certain level of block confirmations to ensure practical finality and deem a crypto transaction legitimate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The first component of a flag pattern is a flag pole, which is formed by a significant price upsurge or a price decline. This is followed by a price consolidation, which happens between two narrow parallel trendlines, which are downward sloping if the flagpole is formed with a price increase, or upward sloping if the flagpole is formed with a price decline. Flag patterns got their name because they visually resemble a flying flag.</p>

<p>When a hard fork occurs, all nodes have to update to the new protocol if they want to follow the new branch of the blockchain. This branch won't recognise any nodes using the old protocol. However, all the nodes that use the old protocol can still follow the other branch. The two blockchains have identical history up to the fork, but go their separate ways after it. A hard fork results in the creation of a new cryptocurrency, independent from the original. Bitcoin Cash is an example of a hard fork from Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The hash is deterministic, meaning that it will always be the same when the same input is used. It is also a one-way function and it cannot be reversed, making it infeasible to extract original data solely from the hash. Hashes can be found throughout blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. They appear in block headers, transaction signatures, public and private keys etc. In some cases, hashes can also be of variable length.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies have a set target block time and their algorithm adapts so that the actual block time comes as close to it as possible. The hash rate corresponds to the computing power available in the network. In order to keep block times steady, the difficulty needs to increase as the hash rate rises and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Hashed timelock contracts use hashlocks and timelocks to create the conditions under which a payment can be finalized. Hashlocks require that a certain piece of data is revealed as cryptographic proof and timelocks restrict the spending of the funds before a specific time (usually expressed in block height). If either condition isn't met, the payment can't go through and is returned to the sender. HTLCs are most notably used in atomic swaps and payment channels.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Hashing is a process that is relatively easy to perform, but impossible to reverse. The only way to determine the original string is by using brute force, that is, attempting random strings until you find the solution. When hashed, any amount of data will produce a unique string of characters that is usually of fixed length. Some hashing algorithms limit the output of characters that are easily confused for one another (capital 'O' and zero '0', capital 'I' and lower case 'l', for instance). The result of hashing is the hash. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, Ethereum uses Keccak256 and Litecoin uses scrypt, to name some.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Hashlocks restrict the spending of funds that have been sent as payment before the recipient presents a particular cryptographic proof. Such proof usually requires the recipient to reveal the pre-image of a hash and thus demonstrate they have completed a task (such as creating a payment to someone else) by which they have been given the pre-image. Hashlocks are used in payment channels and atomic swaps.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Head and shoulders is a bearish pattern which consists of three peaks. The two lower peaks at the sides are called the shoulders, while the higher middle peak is called the head. The pattern starts with a price surge, forming the first top – the left shoulder. After price correction, the price picks up and rallies above the first shoulder, establishing a higher high and forming the head of the pattern after a price correction. At the end there’s a final price surge, which forms the last peak, also known as the right shoulder.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>In a bull market, the price is constantly forming higher highs, since the price of an asset is increasing and constantly reaching new highs. Higher highs indicate bullishness and signify a trend continuation. However, when trading higher highs, traders should also utilize other technical indicators to identify if the trend is likely to continue, or a newly formed higher high is actually a point of a trend reversal.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>While some people are actively trading their assets, holders prefer to keep them for extended periods of time. This means that they securely store their purchased assets and are prepared to wait for months or even years before selling it. This kind of strategy drastically decreases stress and time involved in trading. Holder, sometimes spelt 'hodler', is a particularly popular expression in crypto circles.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Holding is not an active trading method, as it merely consists of purchasing an asset and then keeping it stored safely. Holders do not sell their holdings in any market conditions, even if their purchased assets have experienced massive gains during a bull market or losses during a bear market. They firmly believe that the price will keep reaching new highs in the long run. Holders rely on fundamental analysis, as this helps them to estimate the asset’s potential value increase in the distant future.</p>

<p>To find a price level where a meaningful horizontal line can be drawn, a trader has to spot where on the chart the price has bounced off the same levels multiple times. In other words, they have to figure out which levels represent a significant barrier for the price. When an asset is trading above the drawn line, it acts as a support, and when it is below the line, it acts as a resistance. The space between two horizontal lines is called a range.</p>

Initial exchange offering makes investment in a blockchain start-up somewhat less risky, as it is executed and controlled by an exchange.</p>

<p>The basics of investing are simple: buy an asset, be it shares, real estate or cryptocurrency, wait for the value of the investment to grow and then sell the asset with a profit. However, far more elaborate methods for investing are nowadays employed by retail and institutional investor alike. In theory, investing is a long-term-oriented method and does not involve active trading. Therefore, the number of trades per year, or even several years, is miniscule. The ultimate challenge in investing is to time the purchase perfectly. The prime time to invest is at the start of a bullish market cycle. Investors usually utilize technical analysis to find a suitable trade entry point, while fundamental analysis is used for long-term price evaluation.</p>

<p>Investors are very long-term focused and don't bother with short-term market price fluctuations, as they usually keep their investments in assets for years before selling them at higher prices. Investors are usually separated into institutional and retail investors, depending on whether investing is their profession, or a part-time occupation or hobby.</p>

<p>Issuance can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the cryptocurrency. Proof of work cryptocurrencies release new coins from a limited pool of unmined coins whenever a new block is mined. With Bitcoin, 6.25 BTC is made available to the fastest miner approximately every 10 minutes (note that the mining reward undergoes halving). Some cryptocurrencies chose a different path. For example, Ripple created 100 billion XRP from the get-go, escrowed 55%, and now makes 1 billion from the escrow available to be put into circulation every month (whatever remains is put back into the escrow).</p>

The histogram is a column chart that prints columns above the zero value when the faster moving average is above the slower one, and below the zero value when the faster moving average is below the slower one. The bigger the space between the moving averages, the bigger the columns of a histogram are. The histogram reflects how strong the current trend is.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>With market order you specify the amount of coins or tokens you want to buy or sell. The order gets executed immediately at the best available market price, meaning that you buy at the lowest available published asks or sell at the highest available published bids in the order book. Other types of common order types include the instant order, the limit order and the stop order.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Market trends indicate whether the prices are ascending (a bullish trend) or descending (a bearish trend). It is also possible that the market enters a state where it is going neither up nor down (a sideways trend). Technical analysts attempt to predict market trends using various technical indicators, candlestick patterns and chart patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Most cryptocurrencies have a hard limit on how many coins or tokens can ever exist. This feature stops an infinite influx of coins, thus preventing inflation. Bitcoin's limit is at 21 million (over 18 million of which have been mined), while Litecoin's limit is 84 million.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>For various reasons, but mostly because blockchains tend to impose a block size limit, not all transactions that are propagated across the network can be inserted in the very next block. Until such a time that they are picked up by a miner, the transactions wait in the mempool. Theoretically, a transaction can be stuck in the mempool forever (say, if the attached fee is simply too small to bother the miners), but this is highly unlikely to happen.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Mining means gathering new transactions and sealing them into a block. The block is sealed by means of solving a complex computational puzzle. This provides the block with a hash that satisfies the condition for difficulty. Since finding this hash is a resource-intensive process, the miner is compensated by fees attached to transactions in the block as well as the block reward. Miners compete for this reward, as it represents their primary source of income.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>In a mining pool, numerous miners join together by offering the processing power of their devices. Together, they are more likely to present the proof of work than if they were working alone. If successful, they share the mining reward. Mining pools have become a major player in the mining of some cryptocurrencies, which has raised some concerns regarding these cryptos' decentralized status.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Moving averages smooth price action by filtering out random, short-term fluctuations in price, also known as 'noise'. There are two types of moving averages: the simple moving average (SMA) and the exponential moving average (EMA). The difference between them is the sensitivity, as SMA reacts to the price fluctuations much slower than the EMA. The most commonly used moving averages span over 50, 100 or 200 days. Traders usually keep a close watch on 50-day and 200-day moving average to spot the occurrences of the golden cross or the death cross. Moving averages are lagging indicators, because they provide results after a price change had occurred and are thus used to confirm a pattern that is already in progress.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>NFTs are a subclass of cryptocurrency tokens that are used to represent specific assets, either digital or in the real world. If you exchange one bitcoin for another, no change occurred, as the coins are equivalent – they are fungible. Each NFT is unique, so for each NFT, no equivalent token exists.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The nonce is a field into which a value can be inserted by the miner when creating a new block, allowing the block hash to be on the difficulty target. The only way to achieve this is to try different nonce values until a satisfactory hash is produced. The hash is considered satisfactory if a certain number of zeros to appear at the start of the hash. The number of zeroes depends on the difficulty target. Nodes have a different function on some blockchains. On Ethereum, for instance, they are an essential part of validating transactions.</p>

<p>Plasma is a series of child chains stemming from the root chain, which is the main blockchain. Child chains attach to the main blockchain by means of a smart contract. A child chain can have children of its own. Plasma re-routes some traffic from the main blockchain and thus enables greater transaction throughput and consequently saves time and money on the root chain.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The Ponzi scheme works by the schemer convincing victims into a seemingly worthwhile investment, whereas in reality, their investments are being paid off by new investors attracted by the schemer. The backend can never profit, and as the scheme breaks down, they will end up paying for the others. It can take a while before the scheme comes to an end, since the requirement for new funds doesn't grow exponentially (unlike with the pyramid scheme). Named after Charles Ponzi, a 1920s swindler who run this scheme for over a year, robbing hundreds of victims of their money.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The presale takes place after the private sale, but before the crowdsale. During the presale, the funding process has been somewhat automated and manual work reduced. The ICO is now open to the public, but investing is still not available to everyone. The team makes a selection usually based on KYC filters, or even a random selection of investors, in order to prevent overcrowding. The presale itself can be split into multiple phases. The price of the coins tends to increase with every phase.</p>

<p>Price consolidation is typical for certain chart patterns, such as the bull pennant, bear pennant and rectangles. Price consolidation also commonly occurs when the price reaches a support or resistance level and remains there, right above the support or just below the resistance. In this case, the strength of the support and resistance is most important – if sufficient, the price will reverse, but if not, a breakout will eventually happen.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Private blockchains allow only a select group of known individuals to join their network. In contrast to this, anyone can join a public, or permissionless, blockchain. While public blockchains are distributed and have no central authority, the notion of centralization is much more prominent when it comes to permissioned ledgers.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>In asymmetric cryptography, the private key is used to decrypt a message. On blockchains it can generate a digital signature with its corresponding public key. Creating a signature is a requirement whenever you want to send someone some crypto from your blockchain address. The private key is sometimes compared to a password: it is known only to the owner of a blockchain address and it enables the owner to operate with the funds at that address. Private keys usually contain at least 256 bits (64 letters and numbers), which makes it practically impossible that any two private keys should be the same.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Proof of authority is a consensus mechanism where the identity of the validator functions as the stake. Individuals who want to earn the right to validate blocks have to disclose their identity, essentially putting themselves and their reputation at stake. This ensures that it is in their best interest to uphold and preserve the network by performing the role of validators faithfully.</p>
</div></article><article id="proof-of-stake" class="definition" data-v-2d5a746d><h2 class="definition__title" data-v-2d5a746d>Proof Of Stake</h2><div class="definition__content" data-v-2d5a746d><p>A proof mechanism in which the right to validate blocks is given based on how much coins or tokens candidates have and are willing to stake as insurance that a particular block is legitimate.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Proof of stake works on the premise that the person who is invested in a network (holds a stake) is incentivized to act in its best interests. The more stake someone has (the more coins or tokens, for instance), the higher their interest in preserving the system. Based on this, an algorithm awards the right to validate blocks to nodes according to how much they are willing to bet on a particular block. As long as the majority bets on the same block, their bets are safe, but if someone bets on an illegitimate block, their stake is lost. Besides simply having a large stake, a mixture of random selection and other factors (depending on the specific project) are used to select block validators. Proof of stake is a faster and cheaper way to obtain complete new blocks than proof of work, since it bypasses the need for the miner to solve a complex mathematical problem and thus saves a lot of time and electricity. Ethereum is a major blockchain with the vision to eventually switch from proof of work to proof of stake.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Proof of weight uses a particular relatively weighted value, such as the amount of data you are storing at a given time, to determine the likelihood of discovering a new block (compare this with proof of stake, where this value is your stake in coins). Proof of weight is actually an umbrella term for an entire array of consensus algorithms largely based on the Algorand consensus model. Examples of proof of weight include proof of spacetime and proof of replication</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Proof of work requires the miners to solve a complex mathematical challenge in order to complete a new block. Since this process is resource-intensive, a block reward is usually offered to the first miner who cracks the puzzle. The primary purpose of proof of work is to ensure that all new blocks are legitimate. It also functions as a layer of defense against several types of attack and prevents spamming new blocks. Proof of work is the first proof mechanism used by any blockchain-based cryptocurrency. Other mechanisms, such as proof of stake and proof of authority have since been proposed and implemented into many new blockchains.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Blockchains of some cryptocurrencies take up a lot of storage area. Therefore, in some situations, full nodes can be pruned, or reduced in size, in order to save some disk space.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Pruning reduces the size of a blockchain by discarding information which is not strictly relevant for the performance of the node. This usually means deleting past transaction data from your local blockchain and only keeping a database of all unspent transaction outputs, or the UTXO database. This drastically reduces the size of the blockchain, but still allows the node to reliably perform the role of validator.</p>

<p>Pseudonymity is the state of privacy achieved by concealing an identity by means of creating a fake name or address. Pseudonymity is not true anonymity, since it may sometimes be possible to infer the true identity of someone behind a pseudonym from their actions. Pseudonymity is used on public blockchains, where a user is represented by their blockchain address.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Public blockchains have no restrictions on who can join the network. In order to ensure that the participants don't act maliciously, public blockchains employ a number of protective measures. A common solution is to make it prohibitively time- and resource-consuming to act against the network by means of proof of work.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Pump-and-dump scams involve an investor or a group purchasing an asset with the purpose of artificially inflating its price and then selling. These investors promote the asset heavily, generating as much interest as possible. False claims and overly optimistic predictions are often used at this stage. The simple act of buying a large amount of an asset also helps start an upward trend that other investors jump on. This artificially created interest will make the price grow rapidly, as more investors buy the growing asset. At some point, the pump-and-dump investors sell their assets, making a profit in the process. Everyone who has fallen for the scam is left with virtually nothing, since after the hype dies out, the price plummets. This type of fraud is common with very small stocks or cryptocurrencies with small market caps, as the price of these assets can be manipulated more easily.</p>

<p>When a fork occurs on a blockchain it may sometimes be possible to replay a transaction from one branch to the other without the initiator's intention or consent. Replay protection makes transactions broadcast on one chain invalid on the other by using various methods: blacklisting addresses, changing signature schemes or changing the transaction format entirely.</p>

<p>Resistance levels are price zones with strong selling pressure. Traders often identify the location of resistance levels and place their sell orders there. Resistance levels are most often determined by drawing trendlines and horizontal lines, but other technical indicators and tools can also be used to locate resistance levels. When the price breaks through a resistance level, it usually becomes a support level. This is known as an s/r flip.</p>

<p>S/R flip is a very common occurrence in technical analysis. When a price breaks out through a support, this area usually becomes a resistance, while price breaking through a resistance turns it into support. For instance, a price moves above the resistance level. After some time the price returns to the same level (previously resistance level) and rebounds there. This means that the resistance level successfully turned into a support level, and therefore a S/R flip is confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The initial purpose of SegWit was to address the ability to change signatures of unconfirmed transactions and, consequently, transaction IDs, a bug commonly referred to as transaction malleability. But SegWit is also prominent when it comes to scaling. It introduces the concept of block weight (which virtually increases the size of blocks by four times), reduces transaction fees by redefining how they are calculated (fee per weight unit). SegWit achieves this by moving witness data outside the base of the block. Thus, it opens the door to many scaling solutions, such as Schnorr signatures and the Lightning Network.</p>

It is mainly used to spot price reversals. RSI stands for 'relative strength index'.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Stochastic RSI oscillates between the values 0 and 100. Its overbought levels are above 80, while its oversold levels are below 20. Crossing these levels usually indicates a high possibility of a price correction. However, in a strong bull or bear market trend, stochastic RSI can irrationally surpass these levels and remain above or below them for an extended period of time. The distinctive feature of the stochastic RSI is that it tends to enter overbought and oversold levels more frequently than regular RSI. Stochastic RSI is therefore more suitable for trading when a price is moving sideways or in a horizontal price range, while 'regular' RSI is better for an uptrending or downtrending markets.</p>

For instance, when you purchase an asset, you can put a stop sell order 10% below your buying price. This means that you will sell the asset if its price reaches your stop sell order price, preventing additional losses if the price continues to decline. A stop buy order, on the other hand, can be used to buy an asset if the price rises to a specified level, ensuring you have made an investment before the price rises further up. The trailing stop order is a variation of the stop order that adapts based on changes in the price. Other common order types include the instant order, the market order and the limit order.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Support levels present potential entry points for a trade. Support levels are represented on a trading chart as straight lines, made by connecting multiple price lows, or using a variety of technical indicators and tools such as trendlines and horizontal lines. If a support level is broken, meaning that the price falls below it, it can become a new resistance level. This is known as an s/r flip.</p>

Compare with swing low.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A swing high is a candlestick which has peaked higher in price than its neighbouring candlesticks on the sides. Therefore we can say that the swing high candlestick has formed a higher high in comparison with the candlesticks on its sides which have formed lower highs. In any given period of time, there is only one swing high; the highest price point. When searching for a swing high for technical analysis purposes – let’s say for applying the Fibonacci retracement tool to the chart – traders should look for a swing high that really stands out on the chart.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>In swing trading, the traders keep their position open a couple of days, weeks and sometimes even a few months. Traders utilizing this method place just a few trades per month. The goal is to buy an asset before it experiences a big price move. Exceptional technical analysis skills are required to perform swing trades successfully. Swing traders often also open a position in anticipation of upcoming news or events related to the asset, which could significantly increase its price in a relatively short period of time. When a swing trade yields profit, the gains are usually reinvested (for instance, from bitcoin to a different cryptocurrency or vice versa), trying to capture another big price movement on an asset the price of which has not yet swung.</p>

<p>The symmetrical triangle is the most neutral of all bilateral chart patterns and should, therefore, be traded with extra caution. It is characterized by a descending upper trendline and an ascending lower trendline. Forming lower highs and higher lows, the triangle tightens, and this is followed by a breakout to conclude the pattern. In a bullish market there’s more chance of a bullish breakout, while in a bearish market it more often results in a bearish breakout.</p>

<p>Trading is an active participation in the financial markets. It includes frequent buying and selling of assets. Some trading methods, such as scalp trading and day trading are short-term focused, while trading methods such as swing trading and position trading are mid-to-long-term focused. Simply put, trading involves buying at a lower price and selling when the price increases after a relatively short period of time. After a price correction, traders often buy the assets they've sold back at a lower price and sell again after price increase. Some traders also utilize short selling. The goal of trading is to reach better results compared to investing in a given time-frame.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The trailing stop order automatically moves the position you have secured in case of price changes. It is often used to secure profits and prevent excessive losses. If the market is bullish, but you expect the trend to reverse, you can place a trailing stop sell order at a price below the current market price. The difference between your price and the market price is known as the spread. As long as the market remains bullish and the price rises, the trailing stop order will raise your trigger price alongside it at the distance of the spread. Once the market falls, the order will trigger at a higher price than set initially. Let’s say the price for 1 BTC is 10,000 USD and you put your trailing stop order at 9,000 USD. If the price of BTC then rises to 10,500 USD, your trailing stop order will rise to 9,500 USD, maintaining the spread. If the price then falls, your stop sell order will get executed at 9,500 USD instead of originally placed 9,000 USD.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine precisely how much computational effort and, consequently, gas writing a transaction in the Ethereum blockchain will take. Allocating too small an amount of gas to a transaction will result in it failing, while you will still have to pay for computational expenses.

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>Blockchains like the one of Bitcoin don't store actual coins, but the history of transactions. If someone has sent 1 BTC to your address, you don't have 1 coin, but one transaction output showing that you can spend 1 BTC. This output is indivisible. If you then want to send 0.5 BTC to someone else, you need to create a transaction and allocate your whole output to it as that transaction's input. That transaction is configured to generate one output to the target address, an output to the miner for the fee and an output that returns the remaining amount of BTC back to your address. Keep in mind that inputs and outputs refer to transactions and transactions only. There is no such thing as a 'wallet output' or 'address output'.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>The Bitcoin blockchain stores no coins or account balances. Instead it stores the history of transactions, more precisely transaction outputs. These are indivisible 'bills' of bitcoin. Whenever a transaction takes place it creates at least one output. If you send 2 BTC to someone, you first need to collect any unspent transaction outputs (or UTXOs) you own to verify you have 2 BTC to spend. This is the transaction input. Then, the transaction will create one 2 BTC output at the target address, an output that gives the miner their fee and possibly also an output that returns the excess back to your address (if you didn't manage to collect an exact amount from your UTXOs). All legitimate outputs are technically unspent, ergo they are UTXOs. Note that inputs and outputs refer to transactions and transactions only.

<p>Transaction throughput gauges a blockchain's 'speed' by observing how many transactions can be completed in a given time window. It is usually expressed in number of transactions per second (tx/s or TPS). Bitcoin caps at approximately 7 TPS, Ethereum at 20, Litecoin at 56, while Bitcoin Cash could potentially reach three digits.

If a trie contains node A, from which grow nodes B and C, such a trie is able to produce strings 'A', 'AB' and 'AC'. Trie comes from the word retrieval, which also determines its pronunciation (although some prefer to pronounce it as 'try' to distinguish it from 'tree').</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>If you want to make a secure transaction with a person who you don't trust unconditionally, you need someone to validate it. In other words, you need a trusted third party to supervise the transaction and make sure nothing fishy is going on. Public blockchain-based cryptocurrencies inherently eliminate the need for mutual trust and, by extent, a trusted third party.</p>

<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>When a new block is mined and added to the blockchain, the validators check if it and the transactions within it are compliant with consensus rules. If everything is in order, the blockchain continues uninterrupted, with the transaction outputs within it labelled as unspent. To guarantee the block's legitimacy, it is sometimes required to reach a certain depth in the blockchain. The distinction between transaction outputs and UTXOs is necessary to distinguish verified transactions from the ones that are a result of a double-spending attack.</p>

<p>Simply put, the UTXO database contains the records of the most recent destination of all transaction outputs that haven't been spent yet. The UTXO database doesn't hold the history of these outputs. Every transaction input has to be checked against this database to verify that it hasn't been spent yet.

<p>An unconfirmed transaction is one that has been published, but has not yet been validated by full nodes. The reason is usually that the attached fee is too small an the miners haven't picked it up. Miners can give preference to transactions with higher fees (more money for the miners), while ignoring transactions with small fees. Another possibility is that the network is simply too busy and since block size is not infinite, only a limited amount of transactions can be written in a block.</p>

Rather, Ripple Labs issued the entire XRP supply of 100 billions at the inception of the XRP ledger and placed it into an escrow. Each month the company is set to release 1 billion XRP into circulation, with any unused amount placed in another escrow. XRP protects RippleNet from spam by requiring a small amount of the crypto to be burned with each transaction. Since XRP’s inception in 2012, close to 10 million XRP have already been burned.

<p>Zero-knowledge proofs require that the two parties, the prover and the verifier, interact in order to establish they have common knowledge on a set of information. The verifier has to prove they have the knowledge and the verifier needs to validate that proof. It is sometimes enough to ensure that a number is in a particular range – this is known as a zero-knowledge range proof. In some cases, a zero-knowledge proof can also be non-interactive, meaning that it doesn't require a prover and a verifier. See zK-SNARK.</p>

Also known as a 'double-spending attack', 'majority attack' or sometimes 'race attack'.</p>
<p><strong>Additional info</strong></p>
<p>A <a href="/learn/security/what-is-a-51-percent-attack/index.html">51% attack</a> is primarily a threat for blockchains created through the process of mining. In a 51% attack scenario, a person or an organization with the majority of the mining power &nbsp;reverses completed transactions in order to spend the same coins twice. This is also known as double-spending.</p>
<p>However, the more computing power there is in a blockchain network, the harder it is to acquire a majority. For this reason, major cryptocurrencies are less likely to be the target of a 51% attack than small ones.</p>
<p>A 51% attack can also be performed on some versions of proof-of-stake blockchains, with the attacker having to control the majority of tokens, rather than hashing power, to carry out the attack.</p>
