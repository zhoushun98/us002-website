With the introduction of \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">Ethereum\u003C/a> came the establishment of blockchain as the technology powering smart contracts.

Scaling solutions were then built “on top” of the foundations they provided.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Core components of L1\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The majority of the most familiar \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-blockchain/\">blockchains\u003C/a> are all \u003Cstrong>layer 1 chains\u003C/strong>. Examples include \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a>, Ethereum, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-avalanche-avax/\">Avalanche\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-cardano-ada/\">Cardano\u003C/a>. These all share certain features that define them as layer 1 chains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Block production\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The individual units of the blockchain—\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-blocks-in-blockchain/\">blocks\u003C/a>—are produced by miners (or validators) and recorded on the network’s layer 1 chain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Blocks are data structures which contain a reference to previously generated blocks in a chain and information about a number of new transactions. This creates the public ledger that we know as blockchain, allowing every transaction to be recorded and accounted for.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Transaction finality\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Transaction finality is the assurance that a transaction cannot be changed or undone. It is the point that a transaction is recorded in an irrevocable state on the chain, and the amount of time this takes can vary depending on how a blockchain is designed. Although transactions can be processed on other layers or chains, the only place that they can be finalized is on the L1 blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Native assets\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-cryptocurrency/\">Cryptocurrencies\u003C/a> that are used to pay transaction fees and reward miners/validators on L1 blockchains are called \u003Cem>coins\u003C/em> (like BTC, ETH, ADA, and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-dogecoin-doge/\">DOGE\u003C/a>) and are necessary for the functioning of the L1 chain. Conversely, those that power decentralized networks and apps built on a L1 are called \u003Cem>tokens\u003C/em> (like UNI, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-dai-stablecoin/\">DAI\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-chainlink-link/\">LINK\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-sandbox-sand/\">SAND\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Security\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>An L1 chain defines the parameters that are responsible for the security of a network. This includes which consensus mechanism a chain uses (e.g. \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-work-pow/\">Proof of Work\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos/\">Proof of Stake\u003C/a>) and the rules that dictate how validators interact on a network. Although other blockchain layers may provide some security measures, L1s are the final word in ecosystem security.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What is the main limitation of layer 1?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Layer 1 blockchains aim to provide the essential functions of a blockchain. The primary goal of any blockchain is to optimize \u003Cem>decentralization, security,\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>scalability\u003C/em>. However, this balance is a hard one to strike, and this is why the concept of achieving all three is called the \u003Cstrong>blockchain trilemma\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Early L1 chains (namely Bitcoin and Ethereum) prioritized decentralization and security, at the cost of the networks’ ability to \u003Cstrong>scale\u003C/strong> with increased adoption. This has inspired L1 developers to either modify their designs to prioritize scaling or work on other solutions “off-chain.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are a limited number of ways that L1 chains can improve scaling by adapting their native architecture. These include:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Increasing block size:\u003C/strong> With bigger blocks, more transactions can “fit” into each block , increasing the speed of the network. The downside is that computers securing the network (\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-bitcoin-blockchain-nodes/\">nodes\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>) must increase their hardware requirements, which risks centralization.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Changing the consensus mechanism\u003C/strong>: Blockchains that rely on Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms can often be faster and less resource-intensive than chains based on Proof of Work (PoW). However, some argue that this comes at the cost of inferior security and centralization.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Sharding\u003C/strong>: Layer 1 chains can \u003Cem>split\u003C/em> their data into a pre-specified number of distinct data components (called \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-sharding-on-ethereum/\">shards\u003C/a>)\u003C/strong>, helping decongest the network and increase transaction speeds. However, the communication between sharded chains can be complex, resulting in inferior security for the blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>How do other layers relate to layer 1?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Because of L1 limitations, developers have sought to improve on the blockchain design by adding architecture \u003Cem>under\u003C/em> the L1 chain (layer 0) or \u003Cem>on top of\u003C/em> it (layers 2 and 3).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Layer 1 vs layer 2\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Layer 2 solutions (L2)\u003C/strong> are platforms that generally improve on the functions (usually scalability) of layer 1 technology. L2s are typically built on top of L1 chains, and often require users to transfer their assets from the main chain to the L2 chain through a \u003Cstrong>bridge\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-layer-2-solutions/\">Layer 2\u003C/a> solutions can be their own blockchains, while borrowing the security of their dedicated L1 network. L2s process transactions outside of the L1 network (“off-chain”) and communicate those transactions to the L1 chain which finalizes them. This allows for more rapid transaction processing and reduces fees for users.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The two main types of L2s are \u003Cstrong>zk-rollups\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>optimistic rollups.\u003C/strong> Both bundle (or “roll up”) many transactions together and submit them as a single data packet to the main chain. They differ in how trust is embedded into the system. In zk-rollups (like Loopring), complex calculations called \u003Cem>zero-knowledge proofs\u003C/em> are used to assure transaction validity. In optimistic rollups (like Optimism and Arbitrum), validity is assumed and can instead be challenged by validators through a dedicated process called \u003Cem>fraud proofs\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Layer 0 and layer 3\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The definitions of \u003Cstrong>layer 0 (L0)\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>layer 3 (L3)\u003C/strong> are even less clear. However, the concepts are just as important to the crypto space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Layer 0 (also known as the social layer) comprises the people who make up the crypto community—everyone from developers to end-users. It also includes the shared trust and vision within that community. By this definition, L0 underlies the building of—and participation in—all blockchain networks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The term L0 is also used to characterize blockchains that underpin other blockchains. These include \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-polkadot-dot/\">Polkadot\u003C/a> and Cosmos, both of which provide platforms and security for multiple, interconnected, application-specific L1 chains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Layer 3 is usually considered to be where blockchains interact with each other, or the \u003Cem>interoperability layer\u003C/em>. Examples of this include Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ripple-xrp/\">Ripple’s\u003C/a> Interledger Protocol (ILP). The term L3 has, however, also been used to describe additional scaling solutions built on top of L2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Layer 1 Essentials\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Layer 1 refers to a foundational blockchain on which blocks are produced, transactions are finalized, and a native cryptocurrency coin is used to pay transaction fees and reward those who secure the network. The most popular L1 chains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>The blockchain trilemma states that L1 chains generally cannot accomplish decentralization, security, and scalability all at once. Therefore, even by adjusting their architectures, there are significant limitations to L1.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>Scaling solutions like layer 2 solutions intend to resolve some of L1’s inability to adapt to increased use. Meanwhile, layer 0 blockchains provide platforms for application-specific L1 chains, and layer 3 refers to protocols that enable blockchain interoperability.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
