But because the price of one bitcoin is now quite high, satoshis are required to express more precise values. They can be used for buying, selling and sending tiny amounts of bitcoin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Satoshis are mostly used for paying transaction fees to \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-crypto-mining/\">crypto miners\u003C/a>. The source code of the Bitcoin \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-blockchain/\">blockchain\u003C/a> also denominates all amounts in satoshi before they are converted to bitcoin for display. This allows the transaction records to be more accurate. Denominating transactions in satoshis instead of bitcoins also makes transactions smaller (in bytes), because working with a large number of decimal points requires a lot more space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The smallest amount of bitcoin that can be sent in a transaction is actually 547 satoshis or 0.00000547 BTC. Smaller amounts are considered spam by the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-reference-client/\">client software\u003C/a>. So transactions smaller than 547 satoshis are declined and are not added to the blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Why do we need satoshis?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Satoshis retain the usability of \u003Ca href=\"/markets/btc/eur/\">BTC\u003C/a> for everyday purposes in light of bitcoin’s massive increase in value since its inception. Without a subunit, the uses of BTC would be limited as the price for a single coin increased by thousands of dollars. But with satoshis, bitcoin can still be used to make smaller trades and transaction payments.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bitcoin is limited by \u003Cstrong>max supply\u003C/strong>, meaning that the number of bitcoins that can ever be created cannot exceed 21 million. When that number is reached, no more mining rewards will be given out to miners. But since bitcoins can be broken down, this gives us many more units to operate with – \u003Cstrong>2.1 quadrillion satoshis\u003C/strong>. For comparison, this number is much higher than the number of USD cents in circulation, and indeed, the number of USD cents that can ever be created, because there simply is not enough zinc and copper on Earth to make them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because you can transact with such a small amount of bitcoin, you don't have to buy a whole coin to own bitcoin. Rather, you can purchase a fraction of a bitcoin with a small investment.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
