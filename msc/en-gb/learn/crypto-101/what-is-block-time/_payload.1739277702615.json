This is how long it actually takes the miners to mine a new block, on average. Block times can change a lot from block to block, because \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-crypto-mining/\">crypto mining\u003C/a> is based on a variety of factors, including luck. That is why we look at average block times instead of individual block times.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Average block time and expected block time are used to calculate mining difficulty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Mining difficulty\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Mining difficulty\u003C/strong> measures how hard it is to find \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/how-does-hashing-work/\">the hash\u003C/a> for a given difficulty target. The higher the target is set, the longer a miner requires to discover the hash for a given target. The mining difficulty target is re-calculated automatically based on how much computing power is available in the network in total. This is done to enable new blocks to be mined at a constant rate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If the average block time is faster than the expected block time – usually due to new miners joining and more computing power becoming available in the network –, the difficulty is increased, so that the average block time becomes slower. It also works the other way around if the total computing power in the network is diminished.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the case of Bitcoin, the level of difficulty is re-evaluated every 2016 blocks or approximately every two weeks. When \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/people-profiles/satoshi-nakamoto/\">Satoshi Nakamoto\u003C/a> generated the first block in 2009, the mining difficulty was 1. At the time of writing, it amounts to about 20 trillion. If the difficulty in 2009 were as high as it is today, it would take Nakamoto millions of years to mine a new block.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Which is better – slow or fast?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There is no simple answer to which is better – a slow or fast block time. Some think that blockchains with slower block times are more secure, as it is harder to hack newly-created blocks. The deeper in the chain a block is, the harder it is to hack. Blockchains with faster block times are not insecure per se, it just takes more blocks to reach the level of security that a slower blockchain would have on a newly-created block.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Generally speaking, faster block times are more appropriate for applications for which it is important that information is added to the blockchain quickly. Slower block times, on the other hand, are more appropriate, for instance, when security is more important than speed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Block times influence how long it takes to transfer cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin transactions take up to approximately 10 minutes, while ether (Ethereum) can be sent from one address to another in a matter of seconds. Based only on block time, Ethereum could therefore be described as handier for everyday purchases, such as buying a coffee, for instance. However, Bitcoin devs have always been aware of this limitation and have produced their own, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-layer-2-solutions/\">layer 2\u003C/a>, solutions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As an investor trading in cryptocurrency through an international exchange, there is no need to worry about block time. That is the benefit of the exchange platform: it lets you enter the world of cryptocurrency investment without having to deal with the details. But the more you know about this game-changing currency system, the better situated you are to make good decisions. In cryptocurrency as in all things, knowledge is power.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
