Proof of work cryptocurrencies release new coins from a limited pool of unmined coins whenever a new block is mined. With Bitcoin, 6.25 BTC is made available to the fastest miner approximately every 10 minutes (note that the mining reward undergoes halving). Some cryptocurrencies chose a different path. For example, Ripple created 100 billion XRP from the get-go, escrowed 55%, and now makes 1 billion from the escrow available to be put into circulation every month (whatever remains is put back into the escrow).\u003C/p>\n",{"firstLetter":1440,"id":1440,"definitions":1441},"J",[1442,1446,1450],{"title":1443,"slug":1444,"content":1445,"linkedDefinition":8},"JOMO","jomo","\u003Cp>The counterpart to FOMO that refers to the happiness of someone who hasn't invested in a fallen market.
