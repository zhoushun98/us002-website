Continuation chart patterns indicate that a market trend, either bullish or bearish, is likely to continue. Reversal chart patterns signify a trend reversal from bullish to bearish or vice versa. Bilateral patterns are indecisive patterns and do not point to a definite direction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Identifying chart patterns\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>When identifying patterns, the most important thing to look for is their \u003Cstrong>shape\u003C/strong>. While patterns are forming, price should respect important resistance and support levels, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-trendlines/\">trendlines\u003C/a> and channels, which are unique for each pattern and lead to its formation. We will cover this in greater depth in the articles on \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-continuation-chart-patterns/\">continuation chart patterns\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-reversal-chart-patterns/\">reversal chart patterns\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-bilateral-chart-patterns/\">bilateral chart patterns\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There are aspects other than shape which are also important to keep an eye on when identifying chart patterns. Often, we must acknowledge the highs and the lows on the chart to identify a certain pattern. The meaning of highs and lows are explained below.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>high\u003C/strong> is a chart’s high point (top), while a \u003Cstrong>low\u003C/strong> is a chart’s low point (bottom).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>higher high\u003C/strong> is a high which exceeds the chart’s previous high.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>lower high\u003C/strong> is a high which does not exceed the chart’s previous high.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>lower low\u003C/strong> is a low which exceeds the chart’s previous low.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>higher low\u003C/strong> is a low which does not exceed the chart’s previous low.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Observing \u003Cstrong>trading volume\u003C/strong> is also very important at certain parts of patterns, as it can confirm or disprove its validity. If the trading volume is high when a price makes a significant move, this confirms its strength. If the volume is low as the price makes a big move, this indicates weakness in the price change, thus the price is likely to be rejected soon after the change.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Chart patterns and time intervals\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Regardless of their geometric shape, all chart patterns have a few things in common. For one, \u003Cstrong>a pattern can appear within another pattern\u003C/strong>. For instance, if you take a look at a one-day-interval chart, you might find a bull flag chart pattern signifying uptrend continuation. Then, if you change the time interval from one day to one hour, you might find a double top pattern, which signals a bearish reversal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Furthermore, \u003Cstrong>patterns formed in larger time frames normally turn out to be more reliable\u003C/strong> and carry more weight. In our case, the double top pattern formed on an hourly chart is not as reliable as a bull flag pattern found on a daily chart. In other words – longer time frame patterns are believed to be better indicators than shorter time frame patterns.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Completion and confirmation of chart patterns\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To effectively trade any chart pattern, its formation has to be \u003Cstrong>completed\u003C/strong> and then \u003Cstrong>confirmed\u003C/strong>. A pattern is considered complete after its shape is fully visible on the chart and it is considered confirmed after the price “breaks out” of the pattern in the direction which aligns with its original prediction. Making a trade before a pattern’s confirmation is risky, as the pattern can easily be invalidated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>There is no better place to start working on your crypto portfolio and test your TA knowledge in practice than a fiat-crypto exchange.

Some predict that a market trend will continue (these are the so-called “continuation chart patterns”), while others predict a trend will reverse (they are referred to as “reversal chart patterns”). A third, and most ambiguous, group contains the patterns that predict the price could go either way (“bilateral chart patterns”).
