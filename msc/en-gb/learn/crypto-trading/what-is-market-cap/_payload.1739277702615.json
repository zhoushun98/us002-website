This helped its market cap reach $382 billion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cryptocurrencies are a relatively young asset class — especially when compared to traditional equities. In the above example, we calculated Bitcoin’s market cap to be $382 billion. By comparison, the Apple market cap ($AAPL) stands at roughly $2.59 trillion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Fully diluted market cap\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In crypto, investors also look at the fully diluted market cap to reach a decision on their investment.

Ideally, the fully diluted market cap should be close to the actual market cap as an extreme difference would stingy that a coin’s current value is overinflated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, on October 19, 2021, Bitcoin reached an all-time high in price at around $64,000. On that date, its market cap was $1.1 trillion and its diluted market cap was $1.35 trillion, which is a difference of $244 billion. This potentially signified that its value was overinflated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What to infer from market cap\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The market capitalization of an asset can help identify its overall price trend, determine the proper valuation of that asset, and compare its total value to that of other similar assets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Using the crypto market cap prices, individuals can assess some of the risks associated with investing in that asset. Specifically, assets can be categorized between small, medium, and large market caps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Large-cap\u003C/strong> cryptocurrencies are typically worth over $10 billion, have generally been around for longer, and are considered major players in the industry. Examples of large-cap cryptocurrencies include BTC, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">ETH\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-tether-usdt/\">USDT\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-solana-sol/\">SOL\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Mid-cap\u003C/strong> cryptocurrencies have a market cap between $2 and $10 billion and are considered slightly riskier than large-cap cryptos, but with a higher growth potential. Examples of mid-cap cryptocurrencies include \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-polkadot-dot/\">DOT\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-avalanche-avax/\">AVAX\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-chainlink-link/\">LINK\u003C/a>, and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-algorand-algo/\">ALGO\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Small-cap\u003C/strong> cryptocurrencies include any coins under $2 billion in market cap. These carry the highest investment risk as they can be either tokens for newer projects that enter the market, or ones serving a more niche audience. Examples of small-cap cryptocurrencies include APE, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-sandbox-sand/\">SAND\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-zcash-zec/\">ZEC\u003C/a>, and BAT.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Investors looking to get a general view of how the cryptocurrency industry is going can also look at the total coin market cap, which measures the market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined.
