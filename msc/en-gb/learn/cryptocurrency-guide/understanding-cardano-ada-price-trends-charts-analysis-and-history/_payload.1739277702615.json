Similar to the general hype around cryptocurrencies at the time, Cardano attracted a significant amount of attention due to its founder, Charles Hoskinson, and his renown as a co-founder of Ethereum. For these reasons, the price of ADA spiked from an early trading price of around $0.02 to a high of nearly $1 in January 2018.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, Cardano has been engaged in a long-term roadmap, so once the initial token launch hype subsided, the broader bear market in crypto took hold. ADA failed to deliver any significant price movements until early 2021. Although this was a time when the rest of the market was also in a bull market, Cardano managed to deliver outsize returns thanks to the launch of its Alonzo hard fork, which brought long-awaited \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contract\u003C/a> capabilities to the platform. Over 2021, ADA would go on to achieve new highs above $2 in May, and even $3.10 per token in September.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like 2018, ADA lost value shortly afterward as the project went back into development for the next stage of its roadmap. Since 2021, ADA hasn’t had any further significant price moves, although it did benefit from the bullish sentiments that swept the market in early 2024 following the approval of \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-a-bitcoin-etf/\">Bitcoin ETFs\u003C/a> by the US SEC. At this time, ADA reached a yearly high above $0.75.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, this is a comparable performance to other similarly-ranked platform cryptocurrencies like \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-polkadot-dot/\">Polkadot’s DOT\u003C/a>, indicating that broader market forces were more of a factor than any individual driver of ADA price.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cardano is currently developing the fifth and final phase of its roadmap, dubbed Voltaire. Therefore, there is a chance that future developments in the roadmap could further impact the price of ADA.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Even while Cardano remains under development, ADA has performed well over the years since it launched, consistently ranking in or close to the top ten cryptocurrencies by \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-market-cap/\">market cap\u003C/a>. However, whether it retains this position will depend on Cardano’s ability to continue competing as a development platform in an increasingly crowded sector of \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-layer-1-blockchain/\">Layer 1\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-layer-2-solutions/\">Layer 2\u003C/a> blockchains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Conclusion\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Cardano is a Layer 1 proof of stake blockchain using ADA as its native cryptocurrency.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Staking and payment of transaction fees are the main use cases driving demand for ADA.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Since trading began in 2017, ADA prices peaked at $3.10 in 2021 following the successful launch of smart contract functionality. However, prices have largely performed in line with the broader crypto markets since the high.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
