A hard fork is a split of the blockchain allowing developers to introduce changes in a new chain without changing the original chain. A hard fork creates two separate blockchains. Up to the fork, both chains have an identical history. After the fork, the networks pursue separate paths.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hard forks usually happen when the community, miners and core developers cannot agree on an important issue. Because they cannot reach a consensus, they form a new blockchain and continue independently.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Why was Bitcoin Cash created?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>In 2010, Bitcoin’s block size was limited to 1 MB. There is no known reason why \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/people-profiles/satoshi-nakamoto/\">Satoshi Nakamoto\u003C/a>, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, introduced this limitation. The most likely explanation is that it was to prevent transaction spamming. As Bitcoin started gaining popularity, block size constraints became more and more noticeable. By 2015, the average block size got to the point of bottlenecking and transaction delays became a real possibility.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Bitcoin community proposed \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-blockchain-scaling/\">several scaling solutions\u003C/a> to prevent this from happening. A possible step forward was to introduce slight modifications to the code in the form of \u003Cstrong>Segregated Witness\u003C/strong>. \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-segregated-witness-segwit/\">Segregated Witness (or \u003Cstrong>SegWit\u003C/strong>)\u003C/a> is a piece of code that virtually increases block size by separating transactions into two segments. However, not all core developers agreed with the introduction of SegWit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The developers who opposed SegWit proposed a different solution. They wanted to \u003Cstrong>increase block size from 1 MB to 8 MB\u003C/strong>. This would permit more transactions to be processed in each block, but it would also be harder to coordinate mining, giving the miners connected to many nodes an advantage over the rest.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since the development community could not agree on a single solution, a hard fork was introduced. It resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash. But for the new cryptocurrency to really come to life, it had to amass a following. The community had to choose which chain to follow – original Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. Once the fork was finalized, the two currencies continued independently of one another.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bitcoin Cash further deviated from Bitcoin on May 15, 2018. Developers implemented a hard fork to \u003Cstrong>increase the block size to 32 MB\u003C/strong>. They also made it possible to start developing &nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contract\u003C/a> technology for Bitcoin Cash.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But this didn’t bring an end to changes in BCH. It has undergone another &nbsp;fork and split into \u003Cstrong>Bitcoin Cash ABC\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>Bitcoin SV\u003C/strong> in November 2018. The former is a continuation of BCH, while the latter, named Satoshi’s Vision, is a new cryptocurrency intended to mimic Bitcoin as it was in the beginning, before forks and updates.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This webpage has been approved as a financial promotion by Bitstamp UK Limited which is registered with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
