To ensure they are acting honestly, they put up a \u003Cstrong>stake\u003C/strong> of 32 ETH which can be \u003Cstrong>slashed\u003C/strong> (taken away) if they do not operate in the best interest of the network. This stake is deposited onto Ethereum’s Proof of Stake chain, called the \u003Cstrong>Beacon chain\u003C/strong>, where it remains locked. In return for performing this service, they can receive \u003Cstrong>staking rewards\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>The Beacon chain: Ethereum’s Proof of Stake chain\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>For most of its existence, Ethereum existed solely as a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain—like its predecessor, Bitcoin. However, in December 2020 Ethereum’s Beacon Chain was created, bringing Proof of Stake (PoS) to the network**.**\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Upon release, the Beacon chain didn’t replace the PoW, instead operated \u003Cem>alongside\u003C/em> the primary PoW chain. Those who wished to become validators of the Beacon chain could stake 32 ETH and contribute to the security of Ethereum’s PoS alternative. This allowed developers to confirm the operability of a PoS consensus mechanism before combining Ethereum’s mainnet with the Beacon Chain. This change formally transitioned Ethereum from a PoW network to a PoS network in September 2022 in an event known as “The Merge.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although the Beacon chain let users receive ETH rewards for validating the chain through staking, it did not allow validators (or stakers who may not run their own node) to collect these rewards or withdraw their ETH deposits. Despite this, more than 16 million ETH were locked in the Beacon chain contract by February 2023.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Shanghai\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum’s Shanghai Upgrade (also called the Shanghai Update or Shanghai Fork) includes five different Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>EIP-3651, EIP-3855, EIP-3860, and EIP-6049 are all designed to lower gas costs for network developers. EIP-4895, which is considered to be the most important proposal, will introduce the capacity for stakers to withdraw their ETH from the Beacon chain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Shanghai will be paired with another upgrade called Capella. While Shanghai is the update on the \u003Cstrong>execution layer\u003C/strong> (where transactions take place), Capella will enable the update on the \u003Cstrong>consensus layer\u003C/strong> (where nodes run the Proof of Stake Beacon chain).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Withdrawal process\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Shanghai will enable two types of withdrawals: \u003Cstrong>partial withdrawals\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>full withdrawals\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a partial withdrawal, a validator will be allowed to collect any ETH above the 32 ETH staking minimum, typically the staking rewards. These are automatic as long as the validator has their withdrawal credentials set to an Ethereum address\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a full withdrawal, or \u003Cstrong>unstaking\u003C/strong>, a validator may remove both the staking rewards \u003Cem>and\u003C/em> their full 32 ETH stake from the Beacon chain. Unlike partial withdrawals, the process is not automatic and there is a limit to the number of validators that can perform a full withdrawal per epoch (defined as 32 blocks). In fact, validators who want to fully withdraw their stake must wait in an “exit queue” before completing this function. In other words, all staked ETH cannot be withdrawn simultaneously, which would otherwise disrupt the performance of the blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Anticipated effects of the Shanghai Upgrade\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Staking ETH enables users to participate in the security of a network while earning rewards for doing so. Prior to the Shanghai Upgrade, however, the stakes were locked as the rewards remained on the consensus layer. Shanghai enables the flow of assets from the consensus layer to the execution layer and thus allows stakers and validators to unlock their staked ETH and collect their rewards.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because Shanghai would provide more certainty about the ability to withdraw staked funds, many believe the upgrade may \u003Cem>increase\u003C/em> the proportion of total ETH that is staked, hypothetically increasing the security of the network and potentially drawing users from other chains to Ethereum.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although Shanghai offers potential benefits in the form of increased security and adoption, some worry about the effect on the price of ETH as validators may withdraw their stakes and sell their ETH on the open market. However, there are rules built into the withdrawal process that would limit this risk.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>What were some of Ethereum’s past and future upgrades?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Through September 2022, there have been sixteen upgrades to Ethereum. Shanghai will be the seventeenth. \u003Cstrong>Frontier\u003C/strong> was launched in 2015 as the first implementation of Ethereum, and the details of the subsequent changes that pre-date Shanghai can be found on \u003Ca href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/history/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Ethereum.org\u003C/a>.
