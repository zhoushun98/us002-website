She graduated from Pennsylvania State University, where she studied international politics and Spanish. After college, she worked in operations at an e-commerce company before joining Facebook in their global marketing solutions department.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Role in the cryptocurrency community\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Simpson took a trip to southern Africa in 2013, visiting Zimbabwe and five other countries. She observed the effect of hyperinflation on the country that devastated the economy and forced the government to move to the US dollar. After she returned from her trip, she sponsored a Zimbabwean family and was surprised at the large fees (as high as 25%) she incurred sending money using Western Union.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Simpson discussed the situation with a friend who mentioned \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a> as a countermeasure to inflation. She began researching cryptocurrencies and was blown away by the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/bitcoin-whitepaper/\">Bitcoin whitepaper\u003C/a> and described it as “the most unique thing [she] had ever seen in the technology world.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Early crypto work\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Following this discovery, Simpson left Facebook to join BitGo, a digital asset trust and security company. She first worked as an account specialist then as a product lead.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>After BitGo, she helped launch Crystal Towers Capital, an early-stage investment fund for Y Combinator companies. She also founded Autonomous Partners, a crypto hedge and venture capitalist fund, that focused on blockchain companies. The fund invested in Talos, a crypto trading platform, and Dapper Labs, a gaming and NFT blockchain company.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Andreessen Horowitz\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Andreessen Horowitz was impressed with Simpson’s work at Autonomous Partners and her knowledge of the crypto market. They recruited her to work on the firm’s cryptocurrency funds. She joined as a Deal Partner and was promoted to General Partner a year later.
