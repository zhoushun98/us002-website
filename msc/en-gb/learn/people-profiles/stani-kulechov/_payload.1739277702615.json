His father bought a computer for him and his brother to share in the early days of the internet. Kulechov became an avid gamer and was fascinated by the global connectivity that came from the gaming community.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The brothers also started experimenting with the Linux operating system. By age 12, Kulechov was building web pages using the PHP scripting language. As the internet and social media grew in popularity, he moved on to learn Ruby on Rails, a web-application framework that Twitter was originally built upon.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He notes that growing up in Finland provided him with a lot of opportunities as well as time to explore his hobbies. At age 15, he dropped out of high school for a year to work on coding and built an experimentational application for users to buy how-to guides online. He then returned to high school to finish his degree.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov noticed the e-commerce, global markets, and crowdfunding sector expanding and wanted to explore the intersection of finance and technology. Enticed by the legal aspect of finance, he went to the University of Helsinki, eventually earning a master’s in law in 2020. He wrote his thesis on using tech to make commercial agreements more efficient.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Role in the cryptocurrency community\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>While at university, Kulechov discovered \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">Ethereum\u003C/a> and was drawn by the prospect of \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/web3/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He was particularly keen in building programs that contained a legal agreements that could enforce themselves through \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contracts\u003C/a>, bridging his interests in technology, finance, and law.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Aave\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov thought that if users can exchange value on-chain, then they should be able to perform other tasks, such as borrowing funds using assets as collateral. The idea spurred him to create ETHLend in 2017 in the very early days of DeFi applications. A few months later, Kulechov raised $16.2 million in an \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering-ico/\">initial coin offering (ICO).\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The project later rebranded to Aave, which is the Finnish word for “ghost” and was deployed on the Ethereum network in January 2020.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Using \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/how-do-smart-contracts-work/\">smart contracts\u003C/a>, Aave lets users lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrency assets without involving a bank or middleman. Described as a non-custodial \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-liquidity/\">liquidity\u003C/a> market protocol, suppliers supply funds to a \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/web3/what-are-liquidity-pools/\">liquidity pool\u003C/a> to earn rewards, while borrowers draw from the pools to take out a loan.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Aave tokens\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Aave launched its own governance token, AAVE, in October 2020. Like many governance tokens, Aave is also traded as a financial asset whose worth was tied to speculation about the value of its protocol.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The company also deployed a native stablecoin, GHO, in February 2023.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Twitter suspension\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov was temporarily suspended from Twitter days after Elon Musk’s acquisition for sending tweets joking that he would become the interim CEO. The ban garnered significant publicity and spurred a heated debate on free speech in social media networks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov took the opportunity to highlight the potential of decentralized social networks that allow users more control and less censorship and are run by independent servers rather than a centralized entity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Lens Protocol\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>A few weeks after his Twitter suspension, Aave released The Lens Protocol, a Web3 social media platform built on the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-polygon-matic/\">Polygon network\u003C/a>. The protocol allows developers to create decentralized social media networks where users own their data.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov said that Aave and Lens share the same mission: “We believe that the ownership of content and profiles should belong to you in the way that DeFi belongs to you.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The project received an investment from FTX Ventures, the venture capital arm of the FTX crypto exchange, prior to the exchange’s collapse in November 2022. &nbsp;The sum of the investment was never disclosed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Investments and thought leadership\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kulechov is an active investor in the DeFi space, providing capital to dozens of projects. He has backed Lido, a DeFi and staking protocol; Maple, an Australian finance firm with a token-governed platform; Slingshot, a crypto swapping protocol; Swivel, another yield-generating DeFi protocol; and PoolTogether, a crypto savings protocol, among others.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Stani Kulechov essentials\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Kulechov is the founder and CEO of Aave, a peer-to-peer
