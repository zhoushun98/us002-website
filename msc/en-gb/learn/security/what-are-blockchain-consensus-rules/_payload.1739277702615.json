Since each node effectively stores a copy of the blockchain, a mechanism is required that allows the nodes to select a reliable block for the continuation of the chain. This is where consensus rules come in.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Every block and transaction within it needs to be in accordance with consensus rules. Furthermore, these rules also determine the basic properties of the blockchain. This includes everything from \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-time/\">block time\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-size/\">block size\u003C/a>, max supply, means of proof (commonly proof of work), to transaction size, signature requirements, available transaction \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-inputs-outputs-and-utxo/\">inputs and outputs\u003C/a> and more. They also determine the protocol by which the validators must check the blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But who determines consensus rules in the first place? When it comes to \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a>, they were originally written by \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/people-profiles/satoshi-nakamoto/\">Satoshi Nakamoto\u003C/a>, but since he made the software open-source, the community now decides on the rules. Any rule change requires the majority of the community to agree upon it. Disagreements may lead to \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-blockchain-forks/\">forks\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The rules are not stored and enforced by the blockchain, but by the \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-reference-client/\">client software\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>. The rules a user wishes to follow are therefore dependent on which client they choose to run. The most popular Bitcoin client is Bitcoin Core, the continuation of Nakamoto’s original client.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Full nodes\u003C/strong>, which store the entire copy of the blockchain, are of greatest importance when it comes to upholding consensus rules. These nodes validate transactions and blocks according to the rules and reject any that don’t follow them. \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-crypto-mining/\">Whenever a new block is mined\u003C/a>, every full node validates it according to consensus rules. If everything is in order, it’s accepted as the continuation of the chain. If not, it’s rejected (\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-orphan-uncle-and-stale-blocks/\">orphaned\u003C/a>) and another takes its place.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Additionally, \u003Cstrong>miners\u003C/strong> tend to select only valid transactions from the mempool to be put into new blocks. They can include invalid transactions (as an attempt to fork the blockchain, for instance), but at the risk of losing the \u003Cstrong>mining reward\u003C/strong> due to their block being rejected.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Trustlessness in consensus making\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/security/blockchain-trustlessness-security/\">Trustlessness\u003C/a> can be problematic for consensus making. If blockchain requires no trust between its users, what guarantee do we have that the nodes don’t just follow their selfish interests? Why doesn’t a node simply validate the transactions it likes and censor the rest?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This behavior is unacceptable because it would allow a perpetrator to re-spend coins that have already been spent, a process commonly known as \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/security/what-is-a-51-percent-attack/\">double spending\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The major reason this doesn’t happen (or rather happens rarely) is consensus rules. If full nodes start validating false transactions and passing around invalid blocks, they will be banned by other nodes (the banning process is usually automatized). Since blockchain operates on a trustless basis, each node must reach conclusions on the validity of transactions and blocks on its own. This way, when the results are compared, unreliable nodes are quickly weeded out.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A means of achieving consensus is indispensable on a distributed blockchain network. Consensus rules are a solution that allows the network to function in the absence of any requirement for trust between its users. While these rules are essential, an average user doesn’t need to worry about them.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If you operate with cryptocurrency through an exchange, it will make sure that your crypto transactions are in accordance with consensus rules, so you need not worry about it. That is why so many prefer to trade via a reliable exchange, like Bitstamp, the world’s longest-running cryptocurrency exchange.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
