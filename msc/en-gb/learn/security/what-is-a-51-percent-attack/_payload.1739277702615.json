Changing the records in any block would require changing all the blocks that came after it, as well. The further back an attacker would want to make a change, the more power they would require to do so. The power requirement grows too quickly for it to be economically viable to change records that are too far in the past. However, an attacker could prepare their attack by stealth mining (replicating the blockchain in secret) for a while, thus avoiding the exponential growth of difficulty that comes with deeper blocks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An attack on the Bitcoin network is still considered hypothetical.

Once a block is mined and propagated to the network, nodes need to determine the right version of the blockchain. Miners compete in solving the proof-of-work puzzle and, in case more than one of them finds a hash at approximately the same time, nodes usually confirm the block that was propagated first.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Most stores, wallets or exchanges will not accept a crypto transaction until it is several blocks deep in the blockchain. When transferring bitcoins to Bitstamp, 3 block confirmations are required before the sent amount is available on your account. In other words, 2 new blocks must be added to the blockchain and validated by nodes after the one including the transaction in question. This way, receivers have the power to decide when to trust the records and protect their funds, in case nodes temporarily validate a false block.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A 51% attack on major cryptocurrencies is unlikely as their networks consume too much computing power to be worth the effort of generating false blocks. We firmly believe that you should only trade what you understand and are very careful in selecting the cryptocurrencies we offer at Bitstamp. This is one of the key reasons that make Bitstamp a safe and reliable exchange.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"July 29th,
