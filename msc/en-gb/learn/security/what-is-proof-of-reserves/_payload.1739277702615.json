After its collapse, several exchanges—including Bitstamp—released a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/25/mt-gox-trading-halts-as-bitcoin-businesses-move-to-assure-investors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">joint statement\u003C/a> promising to “reassure customers and the general public that all funds continue to be held in a safe and secure manner.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The 2019 failure of QuadrigaCX also highlighted the issue of crypto exchange insolvency due to the exchange mismanaging client funds. An auditor who undertook a review of the company noted that it had no accounting system nor bank accounts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, November 2022 saw the most remarkable example of centralized exchange insolvency. \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/people-profiles/sam-bankman-fried/\">Sam Bankman-Fried\u003C/a>’s FTX cryptocurrency exchange famously crumbled after Alameda Research’s (FTX’s sister trading firm) balance sheet was leaked to the media. This revealed a strong indication that their accounts were so closely intermingled with those of FTX that if Alameda Research faltered, FTX would likely falter too. People feared that FTX did not have the assets on hand to cover all customer withdrawals. This event triggered an ensuing wave of customer withdrawals that led to a bank run-like effect, ending with the bankruptcy of FTX, likely permanent loss of billions of dollars in user funds, and crash of the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-cryptocurrency/\">crypto\u003C/a> market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Proof of Reserves allows centralized exchanges to provide users and fellow institutions visibility into the state of digital assets on hand, helping assure stability within digital asset markets.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How does Proof of Reserves work?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Proof of Reserves is simply a partial audit of a firm’s funds by a third party. During the process of PoR, an exchange provides information to demonstrate its ability to cover user withdrawals with assets held in its reserves. The auditor then publishes its findings for the public, and users can confirm their deposits were included in the audit. PoR is typically performed in specific ways to ensure standardization and trust in the system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Terminology\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Although \u003Cstrong>Proof of Reserves\u003C/strong> is the most commonly used label to describe this important concept, there are varying interpretations of what the term means.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some argue that because “PoR” implies only accounting for assets in \u003Cem>reserve\u003C/em>, it does not account for an exchange’s \u003Cem>liabilities\u003C/em>—specifically, user deposits. Specifically, providing a Proof of Assets without a Proof of Liabilities may only reveal part of the picture. There are still merits to publishing PoA alone, but detailing liabilities can provide a more well-rounded assessment of an exchange’s financial status. Still, some institutions only provide PoA and call it PoR.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If an exchange can show it owns a specific wallet, this would provide the requisite \u003Cstrong>Proof of Assets (PoA)\u003C/strong>. If it can also attest to the sum of user deposits, this would fulfill a \u003Cstrong>Proof of Liabilities (PoL).\u003C/strong> Together, these confirm what the community really hopes to ensure: \u003Cstrong>Proof of Solvency (PoS)\u003C/strong>, a more holistic term for PoR.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thus, PoS = PoA + PoL.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Proof of Assets (PoA)\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The simplest form of proving asset ownership is for an exchange to claim a wallet, and then make a transaction with the crypto inside of it. By digitally signing a transaction, the exchange proves it controls the private keys and thus owns the wallet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, this has some limitations when it comes to exchanges’ fiat holdings (which cannot participate in blockchain-powered public transactions like crypto) and assets held in cold storage (offline).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Proof of Liabilities (PoL) and Merkle Trees\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Proof of Liabilities is a bit more challenging because it requires an account for the size of funds a company owes its customers. This carries a significant privacy risk associated with simply publishing users’ names and their deposits. Even if this information were encrypted, there might be risk of a hack that breaks the encryption and makes individual user data public.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Therefore, a cryptographic data structure called the \u003Cstrong>Merkle tree\u003C/strong> (or \u003Cstrong>hash tree\u003C/strong>) is employed to protect user information. In a Merkle tree, data about each individual depositor (name + balance of deposits) is recorded as “leaves.” Usernames are cryptographically converted into data called \u003Cem>hashes\u003C/em> to provide a layer of protection.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Then, each of those leaves is added to \u003Cem>exactly one\u003C/em> other leaf. This creates a “branch”, which is the sum of the two users’ hashes + sums of their balances. On the next level, two branches are combined—their hashes and balances again added together—to create another branch. This process repeats until all balances are added up.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],{"component":51,"props":52,"media":53,"youtubeVideo":62},"section.media",{"centered":36,"withoutSectionContainer":36},{"url":54,"mime":12,"ext":13,"width":55,"height":56,"name":57,"alt":8,"size":58,"horizontalPosition":59,"verticalPosition":60,"responsiveAttributes":61},"bitstampImageUrl/merkle_tree_1png_fd98408c70.png",801,411,"merkle_tree_1png","auto","center","middle",{},{"videoThumbnail":8},{"component":41,"props":64,"content":65,"secondaryContent":67,"ctas":68,"secondaryCtas":69,"ctasNoMarginTop":36},{"centered":36,"withoutSectionContainer":36},{"text":66,"width":45,"align":46},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Image of a Merkle tree from Vitalik Buterin’s article: “Having a safe CEX: proof of solvency and beyond”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the penultimate two nodes are summed, it creates a final node in the tree called the \u003Cstrong>Merkle root\u003C/strong>.

However, there are some important limitations that are worth mentioning.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>First, PoR only provides a snapshot in time of current holdings. This does not prevent institutions from moving assets around before and after the PoR audit. In fact, in the aftermath of FTX’s demise, some exchanges were observed to be sending/receiving large amounts of crypto around the times of their PoR, leaving some to question the integrity of that exchange\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another limitation of PoR is scope since PoR only assures a company's holdings and liabilities (if done right) at a moment in time, and not other risks. Companies can still be vulnerable to other factors such as bad economic environment, poor internal management, or even hacks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Finally, audits \u003Cem>do\u003C/em> rely on a third party to verify that everything is in order.
