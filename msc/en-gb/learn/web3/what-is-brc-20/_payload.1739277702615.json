It paved the way for a bustling ecosystem of fungible tokens on the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">Ethereum\u003C/a> blockchain, all built from the same guidelines so they could be incorporated into \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contracts\u003C/a>. The ERC-20 standard left such an impact on the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-cryptocurrency/\">cryptocurrency\u003C/a> space that it inspired similarly-named standards on the TRON (TRC-20) and BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20) \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-blockchain/\">blockchains\u003C/a>—even though the original naming convention was Ethereum-specific.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In March 2023, a developer named Domo proposed a parallel standard for fungible tokens on the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a> blockchain and named it \u003Cstrong>BRC-20.\u003C/strong> This standard was made possible by previous Bitcoin innovations like the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-the-taproot-upgrade/\">Taproot upgrade\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals/\">Ordinals\u003C/a>. It allows for the minting (creation) and trading of tokens based on Bitcoin’s technology.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within two months of the token standard’s creation, the popularity of BRC-20 significantly drove up activity and fees on Bitcoin’s network, dominated by tokens widely considered \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-memecoins/\">memecoins\u003C/a>. By May 2024, more than 800 BRC-20 tokens had been created.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How do BRC-20 tokens work?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>BRC-20 tokens are fungible assets that rely on the Bitcoin network for their basic framework and functions. However, their invention used the building blocks of two very important advances that provided a necessary foundation:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Taproot\u003C/strong> – The \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-the-taproot-upgrade/\">Taproot\u003C/a> upgrade was a soft \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-blockchain-forks/\">fork\u003C/a> that was introduced to Bitcoin in 2021. It created the ability to perform more complex transactions than were previously possible on the network, including those that use the \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-is-the-lightning-network/\">Lightning Network\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ordinals\u003C/strong> – The \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals/\">Ordinals\u003C/a> protocol was not formally an upgrade to the Bitcoin code. Instead, it was simply built as a way to track \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-is-a-satoshi/\">satoshis\u003C/a> (sats, the smallest units of a bitcoin) and allow for the “inscriptions” of data on these sats that are comparable to \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/web3/what-are-nfts-non-fungible-tokens/\">non-fungible tokens\u003C/a> (NFTs).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Based on these innovations, developers can add (\u003Cem>inscribe\u003C/em>) data onto satoshis that can then be tracked through the Ordinals protocol. For BRC-20 tokens, the inscribed data comes in the form of \u003Cstrong>JSON code\u003C/strong>, which outlines important information like maximum supply and name. Unlike on Ethereum, smart contracts are not necessary for BTC-20s to function.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Other fungible token solutions were introduced to Bitcoin around the same time as BRC-20—all slightly different from the others. Following the same naming convention, SRC-20 tokens use Stamps (rather than Ordinals) to create fungible tokens using JSON code. Meanwhile, Runes launched in April 2024 and relies on Bitcoin’s base code (specifically, \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/blockchain/what-are-inputs-outputs-and-utxo/\">UTXO\u003C/a> and OP_RETURN) rather than a secondary protocol like Ordinals or Stamps.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How are BRC-20 tokens used?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>BRC-20 tokens can be used just like any other fungible token. Unlike BTC itself, BRC-20 tokens can be minted and traded for specific purposes or with specific associations (\u003Cem>i.e.,\u003C/em> with a project). In its early months, almost all BRC-20 tokens were \u003Ca href=\"/en-gb/learn/crypto-101/what-are-memecoins/\">memecoins\u003C/a>. The first of these was ORDI, named to represent BRC-20’s reliance on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI was the first fungible Bitcoin-based token to be listed on a centralized exchange. Many others followed, and trading of these tokens was almost entirely speculative.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Because of the onslaught of BRC-20 memecoins congesting the Bitcoin network and driving up transaction fees, many in the Bitcoin community criticized the project, even referring to its tokens as creating “spam” on the network.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Conclusion\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>BRC-20 is a token standard that defines the rules for creating fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>The basis for the BRC-20 token standard uses the foundation built by Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade and the Ordinals protocol.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cp>In the first year since its inception, most of the activity of BRC-20 token minting and trading involved
