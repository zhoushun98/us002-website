Please do not search for a Bitstamp support number using a search engine. If you shared your Bitstamp or email login credentials with this person, change your password and re-enable two-factor authentication immediately.

This person offered to assist me with my existing account or registering an account at Bitstamp and asked me to share my screen view or enable remote access and to follow their instructions during the onboarding process. Does Bitstamp engage with such third parties or operate through its own agents in the described way and is it safe to engage them in the onboarding process?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A: Bitstamp does not engage with any third parties and does not appoint its own agents to assist with the onboarding process in the described way. Bitstamp will never call you unexpectedly and without prior notice. Bitstamp will never ask a client to share their screen view or to obtain remote access using a desktop sharing application (e.g., Team Viewer or AnyDesk), nor will we ask a client to reveal their account information, regardless of purpose or reason. If anyone asks you to do so, it’s most likely a scam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For your own security, it is recommended that you initiate and complete the onboarding process privately and keep all account information and credentials confidential.

The message contains a hyperlink that redirects me to a website (e.g., \u003Ca href=\"http://www.bitstampplatform.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">www.bitstampplatform.com\u003C/a>). The website looks very similar to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a>, with a couple of minor differences. On the first website, the instruction to enter the username and password appears. Does Bitstamp operate and offer its services through other websites and platforms?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A: No, never. Bitstamp will send you text messages under specific circumstances, such as when you enable Price Alert notifications via text messages, during the onboarding process to verify your phone number, or when you update your phone number. It's important to note that any text message you receive from Bitstamp will always be solicited and legitimate. If you happen to receive an unsolicited text message, especially one with a hyperlink, you should exercise caution as it is most likely a scam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Moreover, Bitstamp only provides its services through the website with URL \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a>. Do not view any websites other than \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a> when attempting to use our services. It is best that you visit our website by entering our URL in the address bar, rather than googling “Bitstamp” and clicking on the first link in the search results without checking if the URL is legit. Any other websites are most likely a scam. Be cautious of any variations in the appearance or URL of the website you are visiting. Ensure that you are accessing the authentic Bitstamp website by verifying that the URL reads exactly as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We strongly recommend verifying the SSL certificate of the website for the domain name *.bitstamp.net. If you have mistakenly entered your login credentials on a fraudulent website, it is important to reset them immediately (change the password and re-enable two-factor authentication). If you received an email from Bitstamp about a suspicious login, check the details and click on the “Freeze” link in the email if you don’t recognize the activity. If your email account may have also been compromised, change its password and re-enable two-factor authentication. If you have clicked on any suspicious links or opened attachments, seek assistance from a computer expert and run a malware scan on your device using a reliable malware removal tool.
