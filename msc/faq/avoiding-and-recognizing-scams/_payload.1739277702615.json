The post/tweet contained a link to a website which in most aspects resembles the one of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a>, with certain minor differences. The website is asking me to transfer an amount of my cryptocurrency to the enclosed wallet address to qualify for the giveaway opportunity. Does Bitstamp operate such giveaways, and should I rely on the information from such website?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>A: Bitstamp only operates official referral programs and promotions as described and found on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a> and other Bitstamp-owned channels. We never ask our users for their cryptocurrency for any purpose. Both the original post and the sharing/re-tweeting account may be fraudulent, together with the website (link) from such a post/tweet. It is important to exercise caution and only access the official Bitstamp website, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/\">https://www.bitstamp.net\u003C/a>, when using our services. Do not trust any other sources or websites. Please also note that scammers can also promote giveaway opportunities while mentioning legit companies other than Bitstamp and posting a giveaway on fraudulent websites.

You should exercise extreme caution when sending crypto to a person you do not know.

If you have shared your login credentials with this person, reset them immediately (change password and re-enable two-factor authentication).
