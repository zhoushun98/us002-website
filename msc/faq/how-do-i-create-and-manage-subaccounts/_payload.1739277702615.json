Sub accounts are optional and their use is entirely free (standard fees still apply to any trading done with sub accounts). Sub accounts make testing different trading strategies, bots, etc. much easier. Click here to open a \u003Ca href=\"/account/sub-accounts/active/?createAccount=True\">sub account\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>HOW DO I CREATE A NEW SUB ACCOUNT?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>On our web page open the \u003Ca href=\"/account/sub-accounts/active/\">sub account management view\u003C/a> and press the “Create new sub account” button. Since sub accounts are differentiated by a unique identifier, no additional information is required upon creating a new sub account. You can choose a custom name, but that is entirely optional.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>HOW MANY SUB ACCOUNTS CAN I CREATE?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>You can have up to 10 sub accounts active at any time. The maximum number of all your sub accounts (i.e. the sum of all your active and closed sub accounts) is 30. If you wish to increase these limits, please contact our support by opening a \u003Ca href=\"/support/\">support ticket\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>WHERE CAN I MANAGE MY SUB ACCOUNTS?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>You can manage your Sub accounts in your in your Settings under \u003Ca href=\"/account/sub-accounts/active/\">active sub accounts\u003C/a>. Please note that after creating an account, attributes like custom name or unique identifier cannot be changed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>HOW DO I CLOSE MY SUB ACCOUNT?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>In order to close your sub account go to \u003Ca href=\"/account/sub-accounts/active/\">Active sub accounts\u003C/a>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Click on the “Close account” button next to the chosen account name.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>A confirmation prompt will appear, showing you all the changes that will be performed upon account closure:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All Sub account balances will be transferred back to your Main Account. All sub account associated API keys (see further explanation below) will be deleted and cannot be recovered. All orders placed by this particular sub account will be closed, with no trades being performed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Please note that closed sub accounts cannot be re-activated.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>HOW DO I PLACE ORDERS WITH SUB ACCOUNTS?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>When placing an order, make sure that the correct account is selected. You can do so by checking the dropdown menu, located in the top banner (next to your balance display). The selected account will be the one to place the order. Note that this dropdown is available only in case you have any active sub accounts, otherwise your Main Account will be automatically selected.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>DO SUB ACCOUNTS HAVE MOBILE SUPPORT?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>Yes, we support mobile access for sub accounts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>DO SUB ACCOUNTS HAVE API SUPPORT?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>Yes, our API supports calls to sub accounts, but with limited capabilities. Until now, all API keys you created were automatically bound to your Main Account. Now you can have several active sub accounts. For more transparency, we have even included the option to choose how to bind an API key (applies only for newly created API keys. Existing API keys cannot be associated with any other accounts). The following applies:\u003Cbr>When using an API key bound to your Main Account, you can perform API calls only to your Main Account. When using an API key bound to a sub account, you can perform API calls only to that sub account. API withdrawals are disabled for sub account API keys.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To complement the withdrawals restriction, transfer API calls should be used to transfer balance between your Main and your Sub accounts (please see the API section for further instructions).\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>CAN I TRANSFER BALANCE BETWEEN MY SUB ACCOUNTS DIRECTLY?\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>No, transferring balance directly between sub accounts is not possible. This can only be achieved by transferring from the source sub account to your Main Account first, and then transferring the balance to the desired sub account.\u003C/p>\n",{"description":7,"ogDescription":7,"ogImage":25,"twitterImage":25,"twitterSite":26,"twitterCreator":26,"twitterCard":27,"twitterTitle":6,"twitterDescription":7,"titleTemplate":28},"https://assets.bitstamp.net/msc/_ipx/enlarge_true&f_png&fit_cover&q_85&s_1200x630/bitstampImageUrl/meta_faq_2d369931b1.png","@Bitstamp","summary_large_image","%s",{"ready":30,"sections":31,"disclaimer":212,"copyright":213},true,[32,76,99,122,154,173],{"title":33,"content":17,"items":34},"About",[35,41,46,51,56,61,66,71],{"noFollow":30,"isExternal":36,"name":37,"value":38,"isEmail":36,"isPhoneNumber":36,"isText":36,"showOnDesktop":30,"showOnMobile":30,"attachment":39,"geofencings":40},false,"Who
