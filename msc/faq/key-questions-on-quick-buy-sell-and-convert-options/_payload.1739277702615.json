First, you can click the \u003Cstrong>Buy/Sell\u003C/strong> button located in the top menu. Alternatively, you can select your preferred asset, click on \u003Cstrong>Trade\u003C/strong>, and find the buy form on the right side of the chart.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For those using the Bitstamp app, simply click the \u003Cstrong>Buy\u003C/strong> option. If you're an advanced trader familiar with advanced orders and the order book, we recommend using the \u003Cstrong>Pro\u003C/strong> version available as the \u003Cstrong>Pro Dashboard\u003C/strong> on the web or \u003Cstrong>Bitstamp Pro app\u003C/strong> on mobile.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We support fiat currencies including EUR, GBP, and USD.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>\u003Cstrong>How can I sell crypto?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>Selling crypto follows a similar process to buying. On the web, you can use the Buy/Sell button in the top menu or go through the trading interface. In the Bitstamp App, click on the Sell option.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We support the same fiat currencies—EUR, GBP, and USD—for selling.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>\u003Cstrong>What is Convert and how can I find it?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>The Convert option allows you to easily exchange one cryptocurrency for another, including stablecoins. Previously, you needed to convert stablecoins to fiat before exchanging them for other cryptocurrencies. Now, this step is no longer needed, and you can convert stablecoins directly to any other cryptocurrency.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>You can access this feature by clicking on the Buy/Sell button.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This option currently includes three stablecoins: USDT, USDC, and PYUSD. \u003Cem>Please note that the availability of these stablecoins may vary based on your region.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>\u003Cstrong>What to do if a certain crypto is not available on Buy/Sell/Convert? Why is it not available?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>If a specific cryptocurrency is unavailable for buying, selling, or converting, it typically means it has not yet met our internal standards for listing on the Quick Buy/Sell/Convert option. In such cases, we recommend using the \u003Cstrong>Advanced Orders/Pro Dashboard\u003C/strong> on the web or switching to \u003Cstrong>Bitstamp Pro\u003C/strong> for more trading options.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>\u003Cstrong>What are the fees for buying crypto?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>When buying crypto, you might notice a difference between the customer price and the market price. This difference, known as the \u003Cstrong>spread\u003C/strong>, covers the risk for Bitstamp and allows us to guarantee the offered price for 10 seconds. If you don’t accept the quote within this time frame, you’ll receive a new quote. Buying stablecoins often results in better quotes because they aim to be less volatile. This service is designed for users unfamiliar with the complexities of orders and order books.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, there is an \u003Cstrong>instant service fee\u003C/strong> for buying crypto directly from external systems like debit and credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Advanced traders who know how to read the order book should consider using Advanced Orders on the Pro web platform or the Bitstamp Pro app.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch5>\u003Cstrong>What are the fees for selling and converting crypto?\u003C/strong>\u003C/h5>\n\u003Cp>There is no instant service fee for selling and converting crypto. However, similar to buying, there is a \u003Cstrong>spread\u003C/strong>—a difference between the customer price and the market price. The spread covers the risk for Bitstamp and allows us to guarantee the offered price for 10 seconds. If you don’t accept the quote within this time frame, you’ll receive a new quote.
