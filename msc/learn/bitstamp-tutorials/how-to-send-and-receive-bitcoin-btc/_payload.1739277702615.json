There are a couple of ways you can go about obtaining a private key. The first option – which should be considered highly insecure, as it exposes your assets to risk – is to let one of the many purpose-built web services generate a key for you. The second option is to let a wallet client generate the private key on your behalf. The third option is to come up with a private key yourself, but there are limitations and rules in terms of the minimum and maximum character count, valid characters and character sequences.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Click here to \u003Ca href=\"/markets/btc/eur/\">buy Bitcoin with euro BTC/EUR\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Click here to \u003Ca href=\"/markets/btc/usd/\">buy Bitcoin with dollar BTC/USD\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Transaction fees\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Since the implementation of SegWit in 2017, Bitcoin’s block size caps at 4 MB. Thus, in theory, each Bitcoin block can only hold as much as 4 MB of transaction data and block data, such as headers (but usually much less, about 1.5 MB on average). Due to the limited block size, not all transactions from the mempool can make it into the next block if the traffic is significant. In order to incentivize miners to include your transaction in the blockchain, the fee you decide upon should at least come close to matching those set by the majority of transactors.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Transaction fees are expressed in \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-a-satoshi/\">satoshis\u003C/a> (Bitcoin's smallest subunit) per byte of block data. If you check websites with BTC transaction fee charts, you will find that fees range from a few satoshis per byte to more than a 100 satoshis per byte. If you set a fee too low, your transaction might never make it into a block and could be dropped from the mempool altogether. But if you set it too high, you will be wasting your BTC, as your transaction would probably have made it into the next block, even if you had set the fee lower.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>So, how is a trader supposed to know how high to set the mining fee for their transaction? It helps to use websites such as \u003Ca href=\"https://bitcoinfees.info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Bitcoin Fees\u003C/a>, which keep track of how high the fee should be set to have a transaction finalized within a given number of blocks.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Send BTC from a wallet to an exchange and vice-versa\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>To send BTC from your wallet to a crypto exchange, like Bitstamp, you will need a BTC address associated with your Bitstamp account, which you can access upon logging into your Bitstamp account and navigating to Deposit→Cryptocurrency and select Bitcoin (or another crypto if depositing something else). Use this address when transferring BTC from your external wallet to your Bitstamp account. As is the case with any BTC transaction, a mining fee must be paid. This fee is deducted off the total amount you are sending. Also keep in mind that crypto transactions are irreversible, so you should always double-check the receiving address before initiating a transaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To send BTC from your Bitstamp account to your external wallet, log in to your Bitstamp account and go to Withdrawal→Cryptocurrency. Enter the address of your external wallet and click “Authenticate and withdraw.” Once again, make sure to double-check the receiving address before you initiate any transaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bitstamp is the longest-running cryptocurrency exchange with a proven track record in reliability and security.
