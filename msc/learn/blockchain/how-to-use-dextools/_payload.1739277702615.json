From the app landing page, you can select the Connect Wallet button and follow the steps to connect and verify your wallet.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Once your wallet is verified, you will be able to access the DEXTools plans. Most DEXTools features are available to users of the free plan. Users on the paid tier can access some additional perks, such as more detailed transaction information, multi-channel price alerts, and copy trading features. Premium tier users gain further access to DEXTools VIP channels. Plans require users to stake the native DEXT token or pay a monthly fee in DEXT, calculated in fiat.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Navigating DEXTools\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The main app landing page, called the DEXTBoard, displays a series of ranking tables for tokens, pairs, and pools. You can drill into the details of any of the rankings by clicking on the specific listing. Alternatively, you can also access any of the other DEXTools features via the main menu. From the DEXTBoard, users can also switch blockchains, change the app settings, and access the user menu. The user menu allows you to upgrade your account or, for paid and premium users, access the user area.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Using DEXTools features\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>All DEXTools features are accessible via the main app menu.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Pair explorer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The pair explorer allows you to search for any token and its available pairs on any supported DEX. For example, if you want to trade \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-decentraland-mana/\">Decentraland’s MANA\u003C/a> tokens, search for MANA, and DEXTools will display a list of MANA pools. You can then click into any of the pools to display a detailed chart and analytics page for that particular pool.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within this page, it’s also possible to drill into the pool transaction history, view reliability scores attributed by other DEXTools users, and view your own positions and interactions with the pool.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Big swap explorer\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The Big Swap explorer tracks transactions by crypto “\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-whales/\">whales\u003C/a>”, holders of large amounts of currency. In lower liquidity tokens, large transactions can have a significant impact on price, so the Big Swap explorer can help identify such moves so traders can better anticipate the market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Multiswap\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Multiswap allows you to configure the interface with up to ten tokens for rapid swaps via a given exchange and blockchain. Simply search for the assets you want to swap, and selecting them will connect using the API of the relevant exchange.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Multichart\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Multichart allows you to set up to ten charts for token pairs on any given blockchain and exchange. Search for your chosen asset, using the filters to narrow it down by blockchain and trading venue. DEXTools charts allow you to change the time parameters and chart type and offer a range of tools and indicators to support \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-technical-and-fundamental-analysis/\">technical analysis\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Stats\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The Stats feature allows you to select any supported exchange to view the most popular pairs.
