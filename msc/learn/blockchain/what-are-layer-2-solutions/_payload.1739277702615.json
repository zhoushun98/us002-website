So, if blockchains are what eliminates the factor of trust, how can it be safe to move a part of the blockchain data to the second layer on top of the blockchain?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is because although they are not a part of the chain, layer 2 solutions are still enrooted in the blockchain. This means that they refer to the blockchain to resolve any dispute and fact-check transactions. In a sense, a blockchain acts like a decentralized notary that cannot be bribed.

It was designed to address transaction malleability, which made it possible to change transaction IDs. Additionally, SegWit virtually increased Bitcoin’s block size from 1 MB to 4 MB by introducing the concept of block weight. But the story does not end here. SegWit provided a platform for the development of layer 2 solutions. The first one for the Bitcoin protocol is the \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/what-is-the-lightning-network/\">Lightning Network\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lightning uses blockchain transactions and smart contracts to create a secure network. The participants in this network are able to transact at a very high speed. The Lightning Network can achieve a throughput of millions to billions of transactions per second. Additionally, the Lightning Network charges very low fees, which is made possible by transacting and settling off-blockchain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of Lightning’s interesting features is that it theoretically allows for cross-chain transactions. This means that we could potentially have transactions between different SegWit-compatible blockchains. The Lightning Network started its testing period on 18 January 2018 and is currently run by over 15,000 nodes, including \u003Ca href=\"/lightning-network-node/\">Bitstamp’s own Lightning node\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Layer 2 proposals for Ethereum\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>One of the most popular Ethereum’s layer 2 solution is called Polygon, a platform that uses interconnected networks to optimize decentralized applications (dapps).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Polygon's networks are built as Ethereum sidechains, or independent blockchains that run separately from the main Ethereum chain with their own security guarantees. However they also leverage the security of the main chain to finalize transactions and store critical information central to their operation. In addition, sidechains often have bridges that enable users to transfer assets between it and the main chain.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Blockchain scaling solutions such as these must be put in place to enable greater network throughput. Effective scaling has the potential to make crypto transactions much faster and more user-friendly without compromising security.
