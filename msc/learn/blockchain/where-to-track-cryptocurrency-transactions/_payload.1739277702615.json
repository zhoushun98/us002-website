If the receiver has been involved in many transactions, the easiest way to find a particular transaction is to search by the exact amount sent. If you’re using a desktop device, you can use keyboard shortcuts to search for the exact amount sent. If you’re using Windows, press Control + F, and if you are using MacOS, use the Command + F combination. Then, enter the exact value of the transaction in the search bar, and your browser will take you to the transaction you are trying to find.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Once you have found the transaction you have been looking for, you will be able to see its transaction ID. Typically, it is a long string of letters and numbers. You can copy this transaction ID and share it with another person.
