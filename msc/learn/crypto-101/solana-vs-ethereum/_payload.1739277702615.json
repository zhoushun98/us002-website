However, Ethereum’s popularity soon became a constraint as it became apparent that the platform couldn’t scale to support the demand for block space, and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/what-is-ethereum-gas/\">ethereum gas\u003C/a> fees soared.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-solana-sol/\">Solana\u003C/a> wasn’t even the first competitor to Ethereum—it was one of many, including EOS and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-polygon-matic/\">Polygon\u003C/a>, that emerged during the 2017 bull market. However, like many others, Solana marketed itself as faster and cheaper than Ethereum at a time when block space on the first blockchain was at a premium.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The project launched on mainnet in early 2020. During the bull market that followed, it gained a significant advantage over rival next-generation platforms when FTX founder \u003Ca href=\"/learn/people-profiles/sam-bankman-fried/\">Sam Bankman-Fried\u003C/a> threw his weight behind the project. Although the fallout of the subsequent \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/ftx-collapse/\">FTX collapse\u003C/a> would hit Solana harder than many projects, it managed to gain a sufficient base of support to weather the storm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As such, Solana remained a resilient competitor to Ethereum, even since the latter \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-ethereum-merge/\">upgraded\u003C/a> from \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-work-pow/\">proof of work\u003C/a> to proof of stake. Solana also gained significant advantages through collaborative efforts such as the Wormhole \u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/what-are-blockchain-bridges/\">Bridge\u003C/a>, making it easier for assets and users to move between ecosystems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Use cases and adoption of Solana and Ethereum\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Both projects are smart contract platforms, so they compete within the various use cases of blockchain. Overall, Ethereum has the first-mover advantage, with a larger community and a better-funded ecosystem. As such, it hosts many of the sector's flagship apps and services, such as the \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-metamask/\">MetaMask\u003C/a> wallet, \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-uniswap-uni/\">Uniswap\u003C/a> exchange, and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-the-bored-ape-yacht-club-bayc/\">Bored Ape Yacht Club\u003C/a> NFTs. Ethereum also has the enterprise/institutional advantage, with more adoption, in part due to the backing of ConsenSys.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Solana has proven to be a significant rival to Ethereum in those verticals that rely on transactions that are fast, cheap, or both, fostering its own ecosystems of \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/\">DeFi\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-are-ethereum-nfts/\">NFTs\u003C/a> and gaming. Derivatives exchange \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-jupiter-jup/\">Jupiter\u003C/a>, NFT marketplace \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-magic-eden/\">Magic Eden\u003C/a>, and space exploration game Star Atlas were all first developed for Solana.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Solana Technology vs. Ethereum Technology\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>While both projects offer similar functionality, Solana is faster and cheaper, thanks to the underlying technology. Solana can process speeds of up to 29,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum can still only manage a maximum of around 45 transactions per second, even following several key upgrades.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Further, Solana transactions cost a fraction of a cent, whereas fees on Ethereum can still stretch to several dollars or even more for gas-heavy activities such as \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-nft-minting/\">NFT minting\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Solana’s consensus model is the core reason for its high throughput capabilities. Like Ethereum, the project uses a \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos/\">proof of stake\u003C/a> model, but it also incorporates a unique protocol for time stamping called Proof of History. This protocol eliminates the need for the validator network to reach consensus over transaction and block times and facilitates parallel processing.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In contrast, Ethereum relies on the validator network to maintain a record of transaction chronology. Thus, the network must process transactions sequentially, which creates a bottleneck during periods of high demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, despite offering many advantages, the Solana network has suffered several incidents of downtime over the years since it launched on the mainnet, where no blocks were produced for several hours at a time. In this regard, Ethereum has the advantage since it has never experienced unplanned outages, maintaining uninterrupted operations even throughout major upgrades like the \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-ethereum-merge/\">Ethereum Merge\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum smart contracts are programmed using the Solidity programming language, whereas Solana uses Rust. However, developers on Solana also have access to the Solana Program Library (SPL), a pre-written set of programs for deploying various applications and processes.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>SOL vs. ETH\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Both SOL and ETH are used as native cryptocurrencies for their respective platforms and can be staked as part of the underlying PoS consensus to generate rewards. In fact, both SOL and ETH are two of the most popular choices for \u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/what-is-staking/\">staking\u003C/a> cryptocurrencies, although Solana rewards are generally paid at a higher rate.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Both coins operate a mint-and-burn mechanism when it comes to the issuance of new coins. Following a 2022 upgrade, Ethereum implemented a model where a percentage of gas fees are burned (destroyed) with each transaction, introducing a deflationary mechanism to offset the new ETH created with each block. If the ETH burn rate exceeds the rate of supply as determined by the Ethereum protocol, then ETH is deflationary. Otherwise, the supply increases, making it an inflationary asset.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Solana issues new tokens at a pre-defined rate, which will reduce incrementally until it reaches the minimum of 1.5%. It also burns transaction fees at a defined rate of 50%, with the remainder allocated to the validator processing the transaction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In terms of \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-market-cap/\">market cap\u003C/a>, ETH has occupied the second position on the crypto ranking tables for many years now. Since gaining popularity in 2021, Solana maintains a relatively stable position in the top ten cryptocurrencies, except for the volatile period following the FTX collapse.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Solana vs. Ethereum essentials\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Solana launched on mainnet in 2020 and quickly became one of the most significant challengers to Ethereum, which had already established a sizable first-mover advantage.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Solana is faster and cheaper to use than Ethereum thanks to its unique underlying consensus protocol, but the former has suffered several outages over recent years.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>SOL is one of the most valuable cryptos by market cap, although ETH remains second following BTC.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"May
