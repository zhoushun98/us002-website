In the case of blocks, the cryptographic principle used is called the \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/how-does-hashing-work/\">hash function\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>. A string of symbols, called a \u003Cstrong>hash\u003C/strong>, is determined through a hashing algorithm. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, but not all cryptocurrencies use the same algorithm. This algorithm takes all the data in a block and turns it into a unique string of symbols that serve as the block’s ID.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The hash of the block (the \u003Cstrong>block header\u003C/strong>) is formed from the \u003Cstrong>six elements that make up a block\u003C/strong>:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>The \u003Cstrong>version number\u003C/strong> of the block,\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The \u003Cstrong>hash of the previous block\u003C/strong> in the chain,\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A code generated from \u003Cstrong>transaction data\u003C/strong>,\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>A \u003Cstrong>timestamp\u003C/strong> of when the block was created,\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>The \u003Cstrong>difficulty target\u003C/strong> that adjusts the difficulty of mining,\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>And a random string of characters called the \u003Cstrong>nonce\u003C/strong>.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>All except the last of these elements are known in advance before a block is added to the chain. The nonce, however, remains a mystery. The purpose of \u003Cstrong>crypto mining\u003C/strong> is to figure out the nonce. The miner who first finds the nonce that satisfies the current difficulty requirement adds the block to the chain, sealing it into the history of transactions. See our article on \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-crypto-mining/\">crypto mining\u003C/a> to find more about how this is done.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Understand what you trade\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>There are many misconceptions about cryptocurrencies, and understandably people may be wary of using something that is all-too-often over-hyped, while under-explained.
