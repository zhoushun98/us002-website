This often involves a CEO, other executives, and a board of directors. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although policies that establish this hierarchy vary internationally, in the United States the boards of public corporations are generally elected by shareholders. However, shareholders don’t have the ability to make discrete, day-to-day operational decisions. While they might have the right to vote on major issues, this mechanism is underutilized by the average investor due to various barriers, such as registration requirements, timeliness of information and sometimes blurred cut-off dates for voting. Decision-making is therefore left to those at the top of the hierarchy. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>The rationale for DAOs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/blockchain/centralized-and-decentralized-networks/\">Decentralization\u003C/a> has been a core tenet of blockchain technology since its inception. It has long been hypothesized that \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/people-profiles/satoshi-nakamoto/\">Satoshi Nakamoto\u003C/a> was inspired to create \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a> because of the failures that led to the 2008 financial crash, implicitly aiming to bypass the need for institutional trust and put financial power back in the hands of people. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Just as decentralized finance (DeFi) is the blockchain’s response to traditional finance, DAOs are the natural response to traditional corporate governance structures. DAOs are communities that have a common goal or stake in a common enterprise, like a DeFi protocol or a blockchain-based game.  DAOs exist to govern their communities and make changes to their platform, all while automating the process through blockchain technology. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More broadly, DAOs seek to subvert the traditional hierarchical power dynamic, allowing individuals to vote more meaningfully on commonly held interests and, in doing so, attempt to automate democracy. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>History: the first DAO\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The first DAO was simply called “The DAO,” otherwise known as “Genesis DAO.” It was created in 2016 by members of the Ethereum community and was intended to operate like a decentralized venture capital fund, issuing its DAO tokens on the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">Ethereum blockchain\u003C/a>. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>However, within two months of its launch, the smart contracts were exploited for 3.6 million ETH. In this pivotal moment of early crypto history, Ethereum token holders voted to split the chain in a move called a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-are-blockchain-forks/\">hard fork\u003C/a>. The new (and current) Ethereum blockchain reassigned the hackers’ funds to a smart contract where those who lost their ETH could reclaim them. The old chain became \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-classic-etc/\">Ethereum Classic (ETC)\u003C/a>. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum has since moved on and grown its userbase, ecosystem of dApps, and token holders, whereas the Ethereum Classic community has waned over time. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>How do DAOs work?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3>Structure\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>By definition, DAOs must be two things: decentralized and autonomous. In fact, these are the only qualifications of a DAO, and other aspects vary widely. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Being decentralized means that DAOs must allow equal participation across its members and not rely on a central governing body to make system-wide decisions. Generally, this is accomplished by considering any holders of the DAO’s dedicated token as members. Their voting power is proportional to the number of the DAO’s tokens they own. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Autonomy is accomplished through the application of smart contracts, which are hosted on the blockchain. Smart contracts promise transparent rules and execution of the proposals approved by Decentralized Autonomous Organization members. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>DAOs have historically used a blockchain like Ethereum to record votes and keep them public. However, many now use an off-chain service called Snapshot that stores voting records on the decentralized storage solution IPFS as cryptographically signed messages. By taking the process of voting off-chain, DAO participants are spared from having to pay blockchain gas fees to participate in governance. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 2021, a law passed in the US state of Wisconsin created a legal framework recognizing organizations who explicitly call themselves DAOs and follow this governance structure as limited liability corporations (LLCs), reinforcing and legitimizing the rights of these organizations and their members in the state. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Governance\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Governance can be a complicated procedure, especially in large communities. Think about the voting system in place in your country and how many mechanisms there must be to account for every vote. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the simplest form of governance, members of a DAO can submit proposals to the platform’s forum. These proposals have binary, or sometimes ranked, choices which the community can choose between—for instance, “for” or “against.” Proposals that meet the threshold (e.g. over 50% “for”) are then enacted by the DAO’s smart contracts and developers. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Different DAOs employ different voting mechanisms. Examples include: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Token voting: This is the most common method, where members' voting power is proportional to the number of tokens they hold. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Quadratic voting: This mechanism aims to give more voice to smaller stakeholders. Each member receives a limited number of votes, and the cost of each vote increases quadratically. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Reputation-based voting: Some DAOs incorporate reputation systems, where members earn reputation points based on their contributions to the DAO.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>Some DAOs divide their proposals into steps. In Uniswap, for example, the governance process involves a temperature check to gauge interest in a protocol change, followed by a consensus check that formalizes a discussion around a proposal, and then a final governance proposal which would enact the change if passed. Decentraland’s DAO similarly uses polls, draft proposals, and formal governance proposals to refine its process. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Legal and regulatory considerations\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The legal status of DAOs is still evolving, creating potential uncertainties and challenges, including: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Legal recognition: Some jurisdictions lack clear legal frameworks for DAOs, raising questions about their legal status and liability. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Taxation: The tax implications of DAOs can be complex and vary depending on the jurisdiction. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Securities regulations: Some DAOs may issue tokens that could be considered securities, triggering regulatory scrutiny.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>These legal and regulatory uncertainties highlight the need for DAOs to carefully consider their structure and operations to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Benefits of DAOs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>DAOs offer a compelling alternative to traditional organizational structures, such as: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Decentralized governance: Decision-making power is distributed among members, rather than concentrated in a central authority. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Increased transparency: All actions and transactions within a DAO are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and auditable history. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Community ownership: Members have a direct stake in the DAO's success and can participate in its governance. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Automation and efficiency: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/how-do-smart-contracts-work/\">Smart contracts\u003C/a> automate many processes, reducing overhead and streamlining operations. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Global collaboration: DAOs can bring together individuals from anywhere in the world, fostering borderless collaboration and innovation. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Reduced bureaucracy: DAOs can operate with less hierarchy and bureaucracy compared to traditional organizations, enabling faster decision-making and greater agility. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Trust and security: Blockchain technology ensures the security and integrity of the DAO's operations, reducing the risk of fraud or manipulation.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Types of DAOs\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The different types of DAOs can be defined by the goals their communities have formed around. Some DAOs may fall into multiple categories because they have more than one purpose. As the concept of DAOs evolves and matures, it is inevitable that more types grow from new communities.
