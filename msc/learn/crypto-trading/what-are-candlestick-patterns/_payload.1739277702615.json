It is also wise to remember that bullish patterns have a better chance to play out in a bullish trend and bearish patterns have a better chance to play out in a bearish trend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Candlestick patterns can be categorized into three distinctive groups: \u003Cstrong>bullish candlestick patterns\u003C/strong>, \u003Cstrong>bearish candlestick patterns\u003C/strong>, and \u003Cstrong>dual-meaning candlestick patterns\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bullish candlestick patterns predict rising prices, while bearish candlestick patterns predict falling prices.

The bottom one represents the lowest price.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>In line with market trends, candlesticks can be either \u003Cstrong>bullish\u003C/strong> or \u003Cstrong>bearish\u003C/strong>.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bullish candlesticks are commonly \u003Cstrong>green\u003C/strong> or \u003Cstrong>white\u003C/strong>. Their opening price is lower than their closing price.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Bearish candlesticks are commonly red or black.

It starts with a bearish candle and ends with a significantly bigger bullish candle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>three inside up\u003C/strong> pattern consists of three candlesticks. It starts with a long bearish candle, followed by two bullish candles, with the second one typically being bigger. The first bullish candle is within the body of the bearish candle, while the second bullish candle closes above the body of the bearish candle. The last candle closes above the initial bearish candle. The pattern signifies that a downtrend may end, as buyers gain in strength.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bullish harami\u003C/strong> consists of two candlesticks. First, a long bearish candle is formed, followed by a doji candle or a small bullish candle roughly 25% the size of the bearish candle. Reduced selling pressure from the bears might lead to a trend reversal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Harami” derives from the Japanese word for “pregnant”, with the big candle representing a mother and the small one her child.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>morning star\u003C/strong> starts with a long bearish candle, followed by a short candle – either bullish or bearish – and ends with a long bullish candle.

It starts with a bullish candle and concludes with a bigger bearish candle, signifying that bears have overpowered bulls, which might lead to a trend reversal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>three inside down\u003C/strong> is a bearish reversal pattern formed by three candlesticks. It starts with a long bullish candle, followed by two bearish candles. The first bearish candle is within the body of the bullish candle, while the second bearish candle closes below the body of the bullish candle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bearish harami\u003C/strong> consists of two candlesticks. It starts with a long bullish candle, followed by a very small bullish candle or even a doji candle. It indicates that the bullish momentum has weakened.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>evening star\u003C/strong> pattern consists of three candlesticks. It starts with a long bullish candle, followed by a small candle – either bullish or bearish – and ends with a long bearish candle. As the buying pressure is reduced, and the bears have stepped in, the price starts to decline.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>If the middle candle on this pattern forms as a doji candle, the pattern is deemed an \u003Cstrong>evening doji star.\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>three black crows\u003C/strong> pattern is formed from three red candles with long bodies and almost no wicks. The pattern is clearly bearish and it carries the most value if it forms right after the trend reversal, as it signifies that sellers have overtaken the buyers completely.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Dual meaning candlestick patterns  \u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>three line strike\u003C/strong> pattern can prove tricky to trade. It has two different formations and various meanings. To successfully identify its meaning, one must take into account the strength of the current market trend and other technical indicators.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bullish three line strike\u003C/strong> pattern contains four candles. The first three are strong bullish candles (like the three white soldiers pattern), followed by a long bearish candle, which closes around the opening price of the first candle. In a bullish market, this is a continuation pattern, although it might not seem obvious at first glance. The bearish candle at the end of the pattern only signifies profit-taking from the bulls, meaning that the bulls are willing to rebuy after the bearish candle, which results in the continuation of a bull trend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes in a bear market, or if a bullish market is generally weakening, this pattern can also play out as a reversal pattern, meaning that the fourth – bearish candle – is actually a reversal candle that puts the bullish price uprise to an end. In this case, it could therefore be treated as a bearish engulfing pattern.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bearish three line strike\u003C/strong> pattern is an upside-down mirror image of the bullish three line strike pattern. Three persuasive bearish candles (as in the three black crows pattern) are followed by a long bullish candle. This pattern usually signifies a bearish continuation, meaning that after the last candle the bears step in again and continue to push the price lower.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In a bull market, this pattern could signal a trend reversal, meaning that there is no continuation of a bearish sell-off after the fourth candle.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Understanding candlesticks patterns is a good way to read market trends, in cryptocurrency and beyond.
