When the patterns are fully formed and confirmed, the price is expected to continue moving in the same direction as it has been before the pattern appeared. \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-bulls-and-bears/\">Bullish continuation patterns are thus formed during uptrends, and bearish continuation patterns during downtrends\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Flags\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bull flag\u003C/strong> pattern formation consists of a \u003Cstrong>flagpole\u003C/strong> and a \u003Cstrong>flag\u003C/strong>\u003Cem>.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The pattern starts with a &nbsp;strong vertical price surge accompanied by high volume. This way, a flagpole is formed. The bigger the price surge, the more bullish the pattern. The pattern is concluded with a flag_,_ which represents a slow and steady price correction after the initial move upward. The flag is mildly tilted downward, with a tight trading channel. After the flag is completed, the price is expected to continue to climb up. The initial price surge of a bull flag should occur with significantly higher volume than the concluding price correction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>bear flag\u003C/strong> pattern is actually an inverted bull flag, as it points in the opposite direction, and thus predicts a bear trend continuation.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Firstly, a sudden decrease in price happens, forming a bearish \u003Cstrong>flagpole\u003C/strong>\u003Cem>.\u003C/em> This drop should be accompanied by high volume. Secondly, a \u003Cstrong>flag\u003C/strong> is formed, representing a slow price correction in an ascending trading channel.

This forms a \u003Cstrong>pole\u003C/strong>\u003Cem>.\u003C/em> A bull pennant is formed to conclude the pattern.

It consists of a U-shaped \u003Cstrong>cup\u003C/strong>\u003Cem>,\u003C/em> followed by a slight price move downward – the \u003Cstrong>handle\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the cup is fully formed, a slight decline in price happens – the handle. After this correction, the price should rebound and continue climbing higher – the pattern is completed and confirmed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>inverted cup and handle\u003C/strong> is a bearish continuation pattern, although it can sometimes also signify a trend reversal. Its shape is basically a mirror image of the cup and handle pattern.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The pattern starts with a cup in the shape of an inverted “U.” At the end of the cup, there is an upward movement in price, forming a handle. When the price is rejected at the top of the handle, the pattern is completed and the price should continue falling to confirm it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Wedges\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>rising wedge\u003C/strong> is a bearish pattern, where the price is slowly and steadily climbing, while forming higher highs and higher lows between ascending trendlines. As the trading zone tightens at the end of the wedge, the sell off happens at the end of the pattern, which is confirmed by high volume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The \u003Cstrong>falling wedge\u003C/strong> is a bullish pattern, where lower highs and lower lows are formed between descending trendlines while the price is slowly and steadily falling. After the wedge is formed, the price should break out higher, confirmed by high volume.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Designed through years of meticulous observation by expert traders and investors, chart patterns tend to reliably predict how the market will behave in the future. The tricky part is interpreting a pattern. The slightest differences in pattern shape and timing can lead to diametrically opposite outcomes. Years of practice are usually required to be able to reliably spot patterns and make sound investment choices based on them.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"August 19th,
