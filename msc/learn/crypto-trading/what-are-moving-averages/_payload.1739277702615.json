The more expansive a data set, the larger the lag. For instance, a moving average that takes into account the past 100 days will respond more slowly to new information than a moving average that only considers the past 10 days. This is because a new entry into a large data set has a smaller effect on the overall numbers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Both large and small data sets can be beneficial – it all depends on the trading setup. Larger data sets benefit long-term investors. This is because they are less likely to be greatly altered due to one or two large fluctuations. Conversely, short-term traders normally prefer smaller data sets that facilitate more reactionary trading.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The most commonly used moving averages span over 50, 100 or 200 days. Traders keep a close watch on 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Any breaks above or below these lines are usually considered important trading signals, especially when followed by crossovers (moving averages with different time periods crossing each other). When a faster moving average crosses above a slower one, this is a \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-bulls-and-bears/\">bullish signal\u003C/a>. The opposite is true for a bearish signal; a faster moving average crossing below the slower moving average.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Two types of crosses are particularly important. They are called the \u003Cstrong>golden cross\u003C/strong> and the \u003Cstrong>death cross.\u003C/strong> The golden cross happens when a 50-day moving average crosses above a 200-day moving average.
