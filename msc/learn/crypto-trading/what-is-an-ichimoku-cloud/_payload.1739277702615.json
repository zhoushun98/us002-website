The most popular are the four-hour time frame (4h) and the one-day time frame (1D).

The Kijun sen is used to \u003Cstrong>determine\u003C/strong> \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-support-and-resistance/\">\u003Cstrong>support and resistance\u003C/strong> levels\u003C/a>, while also playing a role in several \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-bulls-and-bears/\">bullish and bearish\u003C/a> crosses\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the market is in an uptrend and the price is trading \u003Cstrong>above the Kijun sen\u003C/strong>, it has the role of \u003Cstrong>support\u003C/strong>. Alternatively, when the market is in a downtrend and the price is trading \u003Cstrong>below the Kijun sen\u003C/strong>, it acts as a \u003Cstrong>resistance\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the price corrects after an upsurge and bounces off the Kijun sen, this is called a \u003Cstrong>Kijun bounce\u003C/strong>. If the price reaction is substantial when a Kijun bounce happens, this indicates the strength of the uptrend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An important feature of the Kijun sen is also the \u003Cstrong>Kijun cross\u003C/strong>. A Kijun cross observes the relationship between a Kijun sen and the asset’s price. When the \u003Cstrong>price crosses above the Kijun sen\u003C/strong>, this indicates bullishness. \u003Cstrong>The price crossing below the Kijun sen\u003C/strong> is a sign of bearishness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Tenkan sen\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Tenkan sen is a standalone line of the Ichimoku cloud, colored \u003Cstrong>blue\u003C/strong> by default. It is primarily used for spotting a \u003Cstrong>TK cross\u003C/strong>. TK cross stands for \u003Cstrong>Tenkan-Kijun cross\u003C/strong>, which signifies a market’s bullishness or bearishness; which one depends on how the cross happens.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>TK cross\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>When looking for these occurrences, it is easiest to simply \u003Cstrong>follow the Tenkan sen\u003C/strong> line (\u003Cstrong>blue\u003C/strong>) and spot where and how it crosses the Kijun sen line (\u003Cstrong>dark red\u003C/strong>).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the Tenkan sen \u003Cstrong>crosses above the Kijun\u003C/strong> \u003Cstrong>sen\u003C/strong> it indicates \u003Cstrong>bullishness\u003C/strong>. When this cross occurs \u003Cstrong>above\u003C/strong> the Kumo cloud (more on the Kumo cloud below) it signifies exceptional bullishness. However, when the cross occurs \u003Cstrong>below\u003C/strong> the Kumo cloud, it only signifies mediocre bullishness and should therefore be traded with caution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When the Tenkan sen \u003Cstrong>crosses below the Kijun\u003C/strong> \u003Cstrong>sen\u003C/strong>, it is a sign of \u003Cstrong>bearishness\u003C/strong>. This type of TK cross happening \u003Cstrong>below\u003C/strong> the Kumo cloud is an extremely bearish signal, while its occurrence \u003Cstrong>above or in\u003C/strong> the Kumo cloud indicates ordinary bearishness.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Kumo cloud\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Kumo cloud is an area of the chart bordered by two line boundaries: the \u003Cstrong>Senkou span A\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>Senkou span B\u003C/strong>. The Senkou span A is ordinarily \u003Cstrong>green\u003C/strong>, while Senkou span B is \u003Cstrong>red\u003C/strong>. The area between them is colored in semi-transparent green when Senkou span A is above Senkou span B, or a semi-transparent red when Senkou span A is below Senkou span B. The Senkou spans are often called the \u003Cstrong>edges\u003C/strong> of the cloud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The same as Kijun sen, the edges of the Kumo cloud \u003Cstrong>act as support and resistance,\u003C/strong> but at other price levels. When the price is trading above the Kumo cloud they represent support, while price trading below the Kumo cloud makes them act as resistance levels.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Kumo edge-to-edge\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Kumo edge-to-edge is a trade setup which occurs when the \u003Cstrong>price breaks into the cloud and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-candlesticks-in-trading/\">candlesticks\u003C/a> start closing within it\u003C/strong>. When this happens, the price target becomes the \u003Cstrong>opposite edge\u003C/strong> of the Kumo cloud.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For a \u003Cstrong>bullish\u003C/strong> scenario this means that when the cloud is above the price and candlesticks start closing within the cloud, the \u003Cstrong>target becomes the upper edge\u003C/strong> of the Kumo cloud. This indicates a good zone to close long positions. Reverse is true for a \u003Cstrong>bearish\u003C/strong> scenario, when the cloud is below the price and candlesticks start closing within the cloud, the \u003Cstrong>target becomes the lower edge\u003C/strong> of the Kumo cloud. This presents a good price level for closing short positions.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Kumo breakout\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>When the price bursts through the cloud and continues to rise or fall below it, and continues to decline, this is called a \u003Cstrong>Kumo breakout.\u003C/strong> If price manages to break \u003Cstrong>through the top\u003C/strong> of the Kumo cloud this is a \u003Cstrong>bullish\u003C/strong> signal, while price \u003Cstrong>plummeting below\u003C/strong> the bottom line of the cloud signifies \u003Cstrong>bearishness\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Kumo twists\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The Kumo cloud color depends on the position of Senkou span A and Senkou span B (it is green if A is above B and red if A is below B). The color changes when \u003Cstrong>a cross of the Senkou spans takes place\u003C/strong>, which is also known as a \u003Cstrong>Kumo twist\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One of the most basic Ichimoku cloud use cases is to determine buy and sell opportunities by observing the current color of the cloud. A basic rule of thumb is that a green cloud is a \u003Cstrong>buy\u003C/strong> signal, while a red cloud is a \u003Cstrong>sell\u003C/strong> signal.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Chikou span\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Chikou span is a line in the Ichimoku cloud that is traditionally colored \u003Cstrong>light green\u003C/strong>. It is a lagging span created by plotting closing prices \u003Cstrong>30 time periods behind the last closing candlestick\u003C/strong> price, meaning that the Chikou span at any candlestick traces the closing price 30 candlesticks ago.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Observing the Chikou span can be used to identify the relationship between the current and prior market trends. When a Chikou span is formed \u003Cstrong>above the current price\u003C/strong>, it forecasts an \u003Cstrong>uptrend\u003C/strong>, while a Chikou span \u003Cstrong>below the current price\u003C/strong> forecasts a \u003Cstrong>downtrend\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This can be utilized to confirm a \u003Cstrong>trend continuation\u003C/strong> or to spot a potential \u003Cstrong>market reversal\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Trend continuation:\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>uptrend with Chikou span above the current price\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>downtrend with Chikou span below the current price\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Market reversal:\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>uptrend with Chikou span below the current price\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>downtrend with Chikou span above the current price\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>Ichimoku as an Oscillator\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Last but not least, the Ichimoku cloud can be used as an \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-rsi-stoch-rsi-and-macd-oscillators/\">oscillator\u003C/a>, to predict whether the asset is \u003Cstrong>oversold\u003C/strong> or \u003Cstrong>overbought\u003C/strong> and has to be corrected in price. This can be read by observing the \u003Cstrong>correlation between the Tenkan sen and Kijun sen\u003C/strong>. When the \u003Cstrong>gap\u003C/strong> between them \u003Cstrong>expands\u003C/strong> significantly, this indicates that the price has to be corrected. This can occur either in an uptrend or a downtrend.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Ichimoku cloud is one of the most powerful and versatile technical indicators. It takes into account many different variables and can show several different trading signals (which can sometimes oppose each other). Mastering the Ichimoku cloud is therefore far from easy. Correct interpretation can take years of trial and error. But with patience and practice, it can be turned into one of the most indispensable tools in the arsenal of the skillful trader.\u003C/p>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"August 19th,
