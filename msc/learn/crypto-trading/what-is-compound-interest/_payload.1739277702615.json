This means that if you invest an amount of cash in a savings account (called your principal), the interest you earn is directly added to your principal amount. When you earn interest in the future, you are earning interest on your principal plus on the interest you have already earned over time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For example, if you had $100 in a savings account that earned 5% annually, you would have $105 at the end of the first year. During the second year, you would earn 5% interest on that $105, meaning that you would have $110.25 at the end of year 2.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Compound interest is an attractive feature to potential investors because the rewards one earns on their principal investment is added to each subsequent payment period. If we use the previous example again over 10 years, the $100 principal investment would turn to $162.89 with compound interest, and $150 without it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-cryptocurrency/\">cryptocurrency\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-blockchain/\">blockchain\u003C/a> world, investors often earn rewards when they stake their assets on a network. In that instance, that blockchain is “borrowing” these crypto assets for a specific purpose, such as for liquidity, validation, security, and efficiency, among other things.
