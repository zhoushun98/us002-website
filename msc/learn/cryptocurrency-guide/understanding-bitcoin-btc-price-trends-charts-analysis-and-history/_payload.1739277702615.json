These events occur every 210,000 blocks (roughly every four years) since Bitcoin’s inception and will continue happening until all bitcoins are mined.

For instance, BTC’s correlation to the stock market has grown over time. Additionally, the rise of asset prices during the highly inflationary pandemic period of 2021 correlated with a large rise in BTC’s price. Further, through 2022 and 2023, traditional financial institutions' growing interest in Bitcoin (including a few adding BTC to their balance sheets) culminated in the approval of the U.S.’s first spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Although there are many examples of events that resulted in rising valuations, certain “black swan” events such as the collapse of Mt.
