Ethereum’s token, ETH, was released in a token sale in 2014, allowing early investors to buy ETH with BTC. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Validators earn ETH for securing the blockchain, and users pay ETH as network fees. Further, ETH is now used to power countless \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/web3/what-is-decentralized-finance-defi/\">decentralized finance (DeFi)\u003C/a> protocols, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/web3/what-is-gamefi-and-play-to-earn-p2e/\">blockchain games\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/web3/what-are-nfts-non-fungible-tokens/\">non-fungible tokens (NFTs),\u003C/a> and more. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Ethereum's Origins\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum was launched by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/people-profiles/who-is-vitalik-buterin/\">Vitalik Buterin\u003C/a> and other co-founders and introduced \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contracts\u003C/a> to the blockchain ecosystem. Unlike Bitcoin, whose primary functions were as a store of value and medium of exchange, Ethereum aimed to be a decentralized world computer and enabling the creation of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-are-decentralized-applications-dapps/\">decentralized applications (dapps)\u003C/a>. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>ETH Price Charts and Market Dynamics\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Generally, the cryptocurrency market moves up and down as a unit, though the degree of movement can vary among different coins and tokens. Because of its long-held position as the second most valuable crypto in terms of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-market-cap/\">market cap\u003C/a>, ETH’s price fluctuations more closely follow BTC than the altcoin market, meaning it has shown slightly less volatility than the rest of non-Bitcoin \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-cryptocurrency/\">cryptocurrencies\u003C/a>. As such, ETH has historically trended with (or slightly lagged) BTC in its \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-trading/what-are-bulls-and-bears/\">bull and bear markets\u003C/a>, and many consider it a market setter than a purely speculative asset. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Still, its unique use case has set it apart from BTC and offered it slightly different strengths and weaknesses. Traders have used technical analysis to predict ETH’s price movements, as they have with BTC and other assets, like stocks. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>While Ethereum's price has historically shown a strong correlation with Bitcoin, ETH's unique use cases in DeFi, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/web3/what-are-ethereum-nfts/\">NFTs\u003C/a>, and other areas have also led to periods of divergence. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Ethereum price history: key milestones\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>ETH gained traction slowly in its early years but exploded during its true major bull run in 2017-2018, rising from $10 to nearly $1500. Despite a subsequent dip, ETH solidified its position as a leader among cryptocurrencies behind Bitcoin. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Just like other assets, ETH’s price fluctuates according to supply and demand. In ETH’s case, these dynamics have changed significantly over time, creating a large-scale experiment demonstrating how a cryptocurrency’s “ \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-tokenomics/\">okenomics\u003C/a>” can influence the price of an asset. For instance, unlike Bitcoin, ETH has never had a fixed maximum supply. However, there are rules that govern ETH issuance. When Ethereum was a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-work-pow/\">Proof of Work (PoW)\u003C/a> blockchain, it promised gradual production of new ETH, and the supply grew accordingly. Some key moments in its history: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>2014: The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering-ico/\">initial coin offering (ICO)\u003C/a> for Ethereum, raising funds for development. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2015: The official launch of the Ethereum mainnet. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2016: The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/ethereum-dao-hack/\">DAO Hack\u003C/a>: A major security breach in The DAO, a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-are-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao/\">decentralized autonomous organization\u003C/a> built on Ethereum, leading to a hard fork and the creation of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-classic-etc/\">Ethereum Classic (ETC)\u003C/a>. This was a pivotal moment that tested the community's response to a crisis. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2017-2018: Driven by the explosion of ICOs on Ethereum , ETH's price surged to nearly $1,500. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2019: Istanbul Hard Fork: Several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) were implemented, improving network efficiency and security. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2020: The emergence of DeFi protocols on Ethereum began to drive significant usage and demand for ETH. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2021: The combination of DeFi's continued growth and the explosion of NFTs propelled ETH's price to nearly $5,000. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2021: The London Hard Fork (EIP-1559) upgrade introduced a fee-burning mechanism, changing ETH's tokenomics and impacting its supply. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2022: \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-ethereum-merge/\">The Merge\u003C/a> helped Ethereum transition from a PoW consensus mechanism to \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-proof-of-stake-pos/\">PoS\u003C/a>, significantly reducing energy consumption and altering ETH's issuance. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2022: The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/ftx-collapse/\">collapse of the FTX\u003C/a> exchange had a negative impact on the entire crypto market, including Ethereum. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>2023: The Shapella Upgrade ( \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-upgrade/\">hanghai\u003C/a> + Capella) enabled the withdrawal of staked ETH, a crucial step after The Merge.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch3>The Impact of EIP-1559 and The Merge\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The 2021 London upgrade introduced EIP-1559, with a mechanism to burn (destroy) part of the supply. This predictably slowed the growth of ETH’s circulating supply, which further plateaued—and even began to decline—with The Merge in 2022, as Ethereum transitioned to a Proof of Stake (PoS) chain. The decreasing supply paired with increasing demand generally results in rising prices. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Other factors affecting the price of Ethereum\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>Market Sentiment: News, social media, and overall market confidence. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Regulation: Government policies and regulatory frameworks. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Technology Updates: Protocol upgrades, scalability solutions, and security improvements. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>DeFi and NFT Activity: The usage and growth of dapps on the Ethereum network. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Competition: The performance and adoption of competing \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/blockchain/what-is-a-layer-1-blockchain/\">Layer-1 blockchains\u003C/a>. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation, and interest rates.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>How to Buy ETH\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>You can buy Bitcoin on Bitstamp.
