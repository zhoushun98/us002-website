However, unlike another leading memecoin, \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-dogecoin-doge/\">Dogecoin\u003C/a>, SHIB price movements have sometimes been connected to fundamental factors such as a mass token burning. Even so, the meme-based nature of SHIB means that it can undergo wild price movements that may not be correlated to any actual events.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For this reason, \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-technical-and-fundamental-analysis/\">technical analysis\u003C/a> of SHIB can be unreliable since it assumes that past price trends will help predict future movements. Nevertheless, under less volatile conditions, technical analysis may help to identify patterns in the price of SHIB.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>SHIB Price and its History\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>As shown in the price charts, the Shiba Inu token has undergone three notable price highs since it launched in the second half of 2020.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following the launch, Shiba Inu’s pseudonymous founder Ryoshi sent half the entire token supply to Vitalik Buterin, one of the founders of Ethereum. In early 2021, Shiba Inu began to rise in price as meme-based assets shot to instant popularity with the Wall Street Bets traders' group on Reddit.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In May of that year, Vitalik Buterin decided to get rid of all his SHIB tokens, donating 10% of the total supply to a COVID-19 relief fund set up for India and sending the entire remaining 40% to a burn address.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This rapid supply constraint created the first price high for SHIB, causing it to reach a price of $0.00003 with a \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-market-cap/\">market cap\u003C/a> of $12 billion. However, the price wasn’t sustained for long, falling back by roughly 70% within a month.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was short-lived, though, since the crypto market was undergoing a bull market in 2021. On October 28, SHIB posted its all-time high of $0.000088, reaching a market cap of over $37 billion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following another dramatic decline, the price of SHIB has largely followed the market since the all-time high, with the notable exception of the departure of the project’s founder in 2022, which caused a temporary crash. However, prices recovered after a developer from the Shiba Inu community, Shytoshi, stepped up to lead the project.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In February 2023, SHIB achieved a new yearly high of $0.00003 as it rose in price along with the crypto markets, following the news that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had approved several new \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-a-bitcoin-etf/\">Bitcoin ETFs\u003C/a>. At this time, memecoins once again achieved viral popularity with traders, as others, including Dogecoin and dogwifhat displayed outsized volatility compared to the wider market.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Shiba Inu remains one of the most popular meme-based cryptos and a staple at the upper end of the cryptocurrency ranking tables. As a token with some utility in its own ecosystem (for example, paying transaction fees on the Shibarium Layer 2), it has some potential to generate demand, independently of the market popularity of memecoins. However, this depends on the ongoing adoption and usage of Shibarium and the Shiba Inu ecosystem.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>How to Buy Shiba Inu\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>You can buy Shiba Inu on Bitstamp.
