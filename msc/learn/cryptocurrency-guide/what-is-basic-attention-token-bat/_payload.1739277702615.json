In return, advertisers are assured that their content is being viewed by a willing audience, and publishers are incentivized to deliver high-quality ads that can draw in more consumers.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>History of Brave and Basic Attention Token\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Brave Software, Inc., the parent entity behind Basic Attention Token and Brave Browser, was founded in May 2015 by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy. In 1995, Eich created the JavaScript programming language and co-founded Mozilla, the company that launched the Mozilla Firefox browser in 2004. Bondy is the current CTO of both Brave and Basic Attention Token and previously worked as a software engineer at Khan Academy, Mozilla and Evernote.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In May of 2017, BAT conducted an \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-an-initial-coin-offering-ico/\">initial coin offering (ICO)\u003C/a> where 1 billion BAT were sold to investors at a ratio of 6,400 BAT per 1 ether (ETH). The ICO received a total of 156,250 ETH tokens worth $35 million at the time.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Diving Deeper into Brave and BAT\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Basic Attention Token is built to operate on the \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">Ethereum\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-solana-sol/\">Solana\u003C/a> blockchains and is central to the revenue share model of Brave.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Publishers produce content, and readers choose which ads they wish to see via an in-browser pop-up notification mechanism that allows users to opt out of specific ads at their discretion. When browsing, viewers also choose their own ad notification frequency (between 0 and 10 ads per hour) and receive BAT token rewards proportional to the number of ads they view per hour.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Advertisers create ads — which are paid for in BAT via the verified creator network — that are targeted towards users they believe value their products and services. In this system, 30% of rewards are distributed to advertisers and publishers to help them maintain their services, while 70% is distributed to users.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Brave Browser: A privacy-focused and secure internet browser\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Brave Browser is an internet browser that uses much of the same open-source code Google Chrome is based on. Unlike most internet browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari, Brave is designed to preserve user privacy, security, and data integrity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of Brave’s most important features include a built-in privacy shield for web browsing and a specialized tracking system that allows users to keep track of the time they spend on ads and websites.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Basic Attention Token and Brave Browser also provide several additional services, including:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Brave Search\u003C/strong> – a search engine designed to be a decentralized \u003Ca href=\"/learn/web3/what-is-web3/\">Web3\u003C/a> alternative to Google, Bing, and others.\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Brave Wallet\u003C/strong> – an in-browser crypto wallet that allows users to access and manage thousands of crypto assets via their computer or mobile device.
