The blockchain is stored as a \u003Cstrong>distributed ledger\u003C/strong> containing the entire history of Litecoin transactions.

They are the basic premises on which these cryptocurrencies were built. But the two currencies differ in a few key ways.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Litecoin vs Bitcoin\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Litecoin was created with the intention of covering transactions that were too small to be economically viable on \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a>. The biggest difference between the two currencies is \u003Cstrong>block creation time\u003C/strong>, or simply \u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-time/\">block time\u003C/a>. The average time it takes to create a new block is 2.5 minutes for Litecoin and 10 minutes for Bitcoin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-are-blocks-in-the-blockchain/\">Blocks\u003C/a> are data containers that are linked on the blockchain. Think of them as secure digital safety deposit boxes. Once information is deposited inside and added to the blockchain, it can no longer be changed. With cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, blocks contain data about transactions on the network.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you send LTC to another address, it is recorded on the blockchain as a transaction. The blockchain holds a complete list of transactions, from the very first to the latest. New blocks are generated through a cryptographic method called \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-is-crypto-mining/\">mining\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This is another key difference between Litecoin and Bitcoin. Litecoin uses a different algorithm to create new blocks. Litecoin’s algorithm is called Scrypt, while Bitcoin uses SHA-256. This difference is relevant for miners, but not for traders and end-users of the system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More important for traders is \u003Cstrong>the difference in total supply of coins\u003C/strong>. New Litecoin is consistently being mined. However, the total number of coins is fixed, just as it is with Bitcoin. The difference is in the number. The max LTC volume is 84 million, while BTC is limited to 21 million coins. The price of these cryptocurrencies is based on \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-trading/what-determines-cryptocurrency-prices/\">supply and demand\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>. Thus, the total possible supply does play a factor for traders.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But having a limited supply does not mean that we will run out of Litecoin. The currency can be divided and transferred in units as small as 0.00000001 LTC. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the world could ever face a Litecoin shortage.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>How to buy LTC\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>You can buy the Litecoin coin on Bitstamp.
