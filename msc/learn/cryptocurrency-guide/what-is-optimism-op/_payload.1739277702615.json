Optimism was created to lift some burden of the main blockchain by processing transactions off-chain, resulting in faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Importantly, Optimism is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to migrate their existing Ethereum dapps to the Optimism network. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>OP is the native governance token of the Optimism network. By holding OP, users can participate in shaping the future of the platform through voting on proposals and other governance mechanisms. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Who Created Optimism?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Plasma Group, a non-profit research organization focused on Ethereum scalability, was founded in January 2019.  After integrating concepts from Vitalik Buterin's rollup design, the team pioneered the Optimistic Rollup concept.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In January 2020, Plasma Group transitioned into Optimism PBC (and eventually the Optimism Foundation), a public benefit corporation founded by Ben Jones, Karl Floersch, Jinglan Wang, and Kevin Ho.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Optimism mainnet was launched on December 16, 2021. The network's native token, OP, was launched in May 2022 through an airdrop. This airdrop rewarded early users and active contributors, further solidifying the community's role in the Optimism ecosystem and empowering them to participate in the network's governance. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Optimism Collective\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Optimism Collective is a governance structure where members can contribute and participate in the network's development. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Collective consists of two governing bodies: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>The Token House:\u003C/strong> OP token holders that are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on governance proposals. \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>The Citizens' House:\u003C/strong> Focuses on distributing funding to valuable projects within the ecosystem.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Ch2>How Does Optimism Work?\u003C/h2>\n\u003Ch3>Optimistic Rollups\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Optimism is designed to make Ethereum transactions quicker and cheaper through a mechanism called “Optimistic Rollups”.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Rollups are a Layer 2 technology that processes data away from Ethereum before submitting cryptographic proof of the data back to the main chain. In that way, Optimism batches transactions together, processes them off-chain, then submits them back to Ethereum.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>L2 nodes in Optimism are made up of several components that work together to produce blocks on the L2 network: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cul>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Sequencer nodes\u003C/strong>: Gather proposed transactions from users \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Batcher\u003C/strong>: Submits batch data to L1, which controls the canonical chain \u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Proposer\u003C/strong>: Submits output roots to L1, which controls L2 to L1 messaging\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\u003Cp>The process is “optimistic” because Optimism assumes these bundles are valid by default. However, there is a challenge period of about 7 days where anyone can dispute a transaction if they believe it to be fraudulent. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>The OP Stack\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The OP Stack is a modular framework for building interoperable \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/blockchain/what-are-layer-2-solutions/\">Layer 2 networks\u003C/a>.

The aim is to foster a collaborative ecosystem for developers to build scalable and efficient blockchain applications and expand the capabilities of Ethereum. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3>Optimism Superchain\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The Optimism Superchain is a network of Layer 2 platforms that share security from Ethereum, a standardized communication layer, and an open-source technology stack.
