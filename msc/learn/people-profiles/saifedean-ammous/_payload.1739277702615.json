He has stated that the economic turbulence he experienced during his youth led to his later interest in economics and monetary theory.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He studied mechanical engineering at the American University of Beirut, going on to achieve a Master’s degree in Development Management from the London School of Economics. In 2011, he earned a PhD in Sustainable Development from Columbia University, where he had previously begun his academic career as a Teaching Assistant.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>From 2009, he was a lecturer in economics, going on to become an assistant and then associate Professor of Economics at the Lebanese American University following his PhD. He was also a Visiting Scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Capitalism and Society.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>He left academia in 2019 to focus on his independent publishing and media career.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Role in the Bitcoin community\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Saifedean Ammous has had a longstanding interest in the Austrian school of economics, which is reflected in his views on \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">Bitcoin\u003C/a>. Austrian economics relies on the theory that individual choice and actions create economic outcomes and is popular among those who support libertarian principles.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ammous is considered to be a Bitcoin maximalist and has frequently espoused his belief that BTC is the only cryptocurrency of any longstanding economic value.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Following his departure from academia in 2019, he set up a company under his own name, dedicated to publishing and promoting his books and other content.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In 2023, Ammous was appointed as Economic Adviser to the National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador.

According to his website, the book aims to provide a “comprehensive and authoritative exploration of Bitcoin and its place in monetary history.” It has been published in 38 languages.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Bitcoin Standard lays out the argument that Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currencies, exploring historical examples of money and its role in economies, and explaining economic and monetary concepts such as \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-trading/what-is-inflation/\">inflation\u003C/a>. It uses the example of the gold standard to establish a concept called “hard money” and makes the argument that Bitcoin can be likened to digital gold.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The book has a foreword by \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/company-profiles/microstrategy/\">Microstrategy\u003C/a> CEO \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/people-profiles/michael-saylor/\">Michael Saylor\u003C/a>, who has previously stated that it had a significant influence on his Bitcoin purchasing decisions.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ammous has written three follow-up books to The Bitcoin Standard.

Episodes consist of a mixture of guest interviews, broadcasts of Ammous’ public appearances, and excerpts from his books and course content. The podcast streams on YouTube, Spotify, and major podcast platforms.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>The Saif House publishing house\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Ammous has also launched his own publishing company dedicated to Bitcoin-related literature called The Saif House. Alongside Ammous’ own publications, it also allows users to buy digital, physical, or audiobooks covering Bitcoin and Austrian economics from other authors and pay with BTC.  \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Other endeavors\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Alongside the books, podcast, and publishing house, Ammous also offers courses via his website, covering similar themes as his books.
