Many do not trust so-called “trusted institutions”. A more practical solution is to do away with our reliance on such institutions completely. A system that always does exactly what it’s supposed to without needing to rely on any third party institutions already exists.

We have to trust that the online store is a legitimate business, that our bank will wire the funds, that the postal service will deliver the shipment, and so on. If anything goes wrong, you rely on officials to uphold the law and enable your money to be refunded, or perhaps even to penalize the online store, if it turns out to be a scam.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Since we’re usually dealing with reputable institutions, most of the time things work out just fine. But most of us have encountered a case in which something has gone wrong and one of the parties we trusted didn’t do their job properly.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2>Blockchain and trustlessness\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Blockchain\u003C/strong> is a cryptographically secure technology that provides immutability, reliability and transparency. It was first developed to provide decentralized financial solutions, but it has since greatly expanded its uses, now assisting with things like \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"/learn/crypto-101/what-are-smart-contracts/\">smart contracts\u003C/a>\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>decentralized applications\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What sets blockchain apart from traditional arrangements is its \u003Cstrong>trustless\u003C/strong> nature. In order to make transactions, sign contracts, exchange digital assets or use any other blockchain feature, \u003Cstrong>you don’t need to trust anyone you’re dealing with\u003C/strong>. The inherent properties of the blockchain, set in cryptographic stone, guarantee that everything proceeds exactly as intended.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When you send \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-bitcoin-btc/\">BTC\u003C/a> to someone, you don’t need any particular person or institution to verify that the transaction has taken place. If you sign a \u003Cstrong>smart contract\u003C/strong> that wires your monthly wage from your employer’s wallet to yours, you will receive the funds without fail. If you upload a \u003Cstrong>decentralized application\u003C/strong> (DApp) that awards every 1,000,000th visitor to your website with 1 \u003Ca href=\"/learn/cryptocurrency-guide/what-is-ethereum-eth/\">ETH\u003C/a>, the award will be given. The uses are countless.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With that said, it is still not advisable to rely on blockchain completely and act mindlessly with your cryptocurrency. If the coder of the smart contract wiring your wage didn’t do a good job, it may have unexpected results (such as you not getting your wage). The blockchain doesn’t discriminate – it will execute the contract regardless of whether the intention was to give you your proper wage or not.\u003Cbr>Though blockchain is trustless, it shouldn’t be called infallible. Yet, it has proven its reliability compared to the traditional model of putting faith in third party institutions. This is particularly true when using blockchain to trade in cryptocurrency. All you need to trade is an account at a crypto and fiat exchange, such as Bitstamp.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n","full","left",{"text":17},[],[],"August 10th,
