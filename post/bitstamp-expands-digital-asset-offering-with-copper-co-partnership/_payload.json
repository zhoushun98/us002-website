As demand increases, Bitstamp continues to provide its users access to the ever expanding market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With multi-award-winning custody, and an Aon brokered crime insurance policy, Copper is a reliable and mature partner to Bitstamp, offering the industry gold-standard in digital asset engagement. Copper’s secure custody uses Multi-Party Computation technology. With MPC, key shards are formed simultaneously and in isolation, one shard each is entrusted to the client, their trusted third party, and Copper. These shards allow transactions to be signed online without the risk of private key exposure because there is no longer one private key. This largely eliminates the risk of key exposure in online transactions. Over 400 institutions already custody their cryptoassets with Copper, which supports circa 450 different tokens.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>“Partnering with the most trusted providers in the industry allows us to better fulfill our obligation of providing the most reliable products and services,” said \u003Cstrong>Julian Sawyer\u003C/strong>, Global CEO of Bitstamp. “By expanding our custodial services through Copper, we will be able to continue to offer secure access to more digital assets.” \u003C/p>\u003Cp>At a time when we are seeing a surge in institutional adoption of digital assets, we’re proud to be collaborating with Bitstamp, which is committed to best-in-class service”, said \u003Cstrong>Dmitry Tokarev\u003C/strong>, CEO of Copper. “Our multi-award-winning crypto custody provides secure access to the world’s most important digital assets and we are pleased Copper’s technology was chosen to broaden the range of digital assets Bitstamp can offer its customers.”\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This partnership is a continuation of Bitstamp’s commitment to expansion.
