The challenge posed to large crypto exchanges is to have a comprehensive solution that handles the different jurisdictional interpretations of the FATF Travel Rule–which is commonly referred to as the Sunrise issue. \u003Cbr />\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One example of this relates to the \u003Ca href=\"https://notabene-landing-page.webflow.io/regulations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">different thresholds and data points set by different regulators\u003C/a>. The Monetary Authority of Singapore requires the ordering institution to value originator and beneficiary information to the beneficiary regardless of the transaction amount, with further information required exceeding 1,500 SGD. The United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) set a suggested crypto Travel Rule threshold of $3,000. In contrast, Europe’s cryptocurrency regulator the European Banking Authority (EBA) set a threshold of EUR 1,000, in line with the FATF recommended guidelines. \u003Cbr />\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As one of the largest exchanges that processes a large volume of transactions to countless counterparties daily, Bitstamp required a sophisticated solution that streamlines VASP due diligence, counterparty wallet identification, automates transactions, and routes Travel Rule compliant data transfers to the largest number of VASPs.\u003Cbr />\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Julian Sawyer, CEO of Bitstamp comments:\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cem>“Our partnership with Notabene reflects our position as a leader in crypto security.
