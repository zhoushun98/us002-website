Friend.Tech allows users to buy and sell Keys (recently renamed from Shares) of Twitter influencers, which grants them exclusive access to private group chats. Unlike traditional adaptations, the application reimagines the social stack for the decentralized Web3 era.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Friend.Tech’s pioneering design presents unique monetization opportunities for content creators and engagement opportunities for users. Since its launch in early August, the \u003Ca href=\"https://dune.com/whale_hunter/friend-tech-ultimate-analytics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">platform has added\u003C/a> over 131,000 users and has seen almost 2 million Keys traded.  This has generated over 2,600 ETH in fees for content creators, which has been \u003Ca href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/64e8a15d8b701c1b93abeaca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly concentrated\u003C/a> (over 70%) among the platform's top 250 influencers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Friend.Tech's launch has also notably elevated the activity on Coinbase’s recently unveiled Base Layer 2 blockchain. On August 21, the daily transaction volume on Base surged to its all-time high, nearing 1.4 million transactions. This figure was larger than the volume observed on other prominent L2 networks Arbitrum and Optimism combined.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Total number of transactions registered on-chain\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/09/graph1.png\" alt=\"total number of transactions registered on-chain\" />\u003Cfigcaption>Total number of transactions registered on-chain\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Source:\u003C/em>\u003Ca href=\"https://app.artemis.xyz/comparables\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>On-Chain Transactions\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The launch of the application was not without criticism. Some \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/DeFi_Made_Here/status/1693277230615413029\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">have labeled\u003C/a> the application as speculative, centered around the pricing of influencer Keys and potential for future airdrops. It also faced accusations of a data privacy breach when its API exposed user information such as Twitter handles and crypto wallets; however, Friend.Tech \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/friendtech/status/1693641339395531072?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">responded\u003C/a> by saying the information was already publicly available and hence not leaked.  Furthermore, trading of Keys occurs through a \u003Ca href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/bonding-curve\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">bonding curve\u003C/a> similar to those used by automated market makers, but the platform’s steep bonding curve makes it extremely expensive for latecomers (after about the first hundred Key holders) to buy Keys.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Despite these criticisms and Friend.Tech’s on-chain activity slump towards the end of August, the project stands at the forefront of integrating social interaction and crypto. Its inventive approach, coupled with rapid adoption, might position the project as a transformative force in decentralized social engagement.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Curve Pool Exploit Sends Shockwaves Through DeFi\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Curve Finance pools were \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1685693202722848768?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">targeted by hackers\u003C/a> in a re-entrancy attack on July 30, resulting in losses of $73 million and plummeting CRV’s token value well into August. The attackers found a vulnerability in certain versions of the Vyper programing language, one of the languages used for programming Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contracts. This issue made some smart contracts vulnerable to \u003Ca href=\"https://certik.medium.com/what-is-a-reentrancy-attack-6516fefc001\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">re-entrancy attacks\u003C/a> which allowed attackers to manipulate balance calculations and steal funds held in various Curve liquidity pools.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Since many other DeFi protocols use Curve pools for liquidity, the attack’s ramifications extended beyond Curve Finance itself. Among the victims were JPEGd's pETH/ETH pool, Metronome's msETH/ETH pool, and Alchemix's alETH/ETH pool. Binance Smart Chain (BSC), another EVM-compatible chain, also \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/vyper-copycat-exploit-on-bsc-bnb-smart-chain-curve\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">fell victim to copycat attacks\u003C/a> due to the same vulnerability, resulting in the theft of approximately $73,000 worth of cryptocurrencies across three exploits.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance, faced a \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-finance-founder-100-million-debt-could-trigger-defi-implosion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">precarious situation\u003C/a> with around $100 million in loans backed by 47% of the circulating CRV tokens. The CRV price plummeted by nearly 39% post-hack, driven by concerns of potential liquidation of Egorov's collateralized loans.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>CRV-USD Price Chart\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/09/Graph-2.png\" alt=\"crv-usd price chart\" />\u003Cfigcaption>CRV-USD Price Chart\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Source:\u003Cstrong> \u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003Ca href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>CRV Price Chart\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In response to the hack, a consortium of white hat hackers and maximal extractable value (MEV) bot operators helped to recover some of the funds. c0ffeebabe.eth, a white hat hacker, employed an MEV Ethereu,m-arbitrage trading bot to front-run the hackers' actions, ultimately returning 2,879 ETH (approximately $5.4 million) to Curve Finance, according to \u003Ca href=\"https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb76754124fdde090f25129105ed2907e3c62e0db87ecb8ffcefcb1dede0954fd\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">on-chain data\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>On August 3, Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-metronome-alchemix-offering-bug-bounty-vyper-hack\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">jointly introduced\u003C/a> an initiative to reclaim the stolen funds by offering a 10% bounty, valued at almost $7 million, and pledging no further legal actions or involvement of law enforcement. Remarkably, within 24 hours, the original attacker appeared to accept the bounty offer and \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/curve-hack-mev-bot-behind-61m-heist-begins-returning-funds\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">initiated the restitution\u003C/a> of stolen funds. The hacker restored 4,820.55 alETH (approximately $8.9 million) to the Alchemix Finance team and 1 ETH (approximately $1,800) to the Curve Finance team. On August 5, the attacker completed the restitution process, returning all stolen assets to Alchemix and JPEGd. In total, Curve Finance \u003Ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/07/curve-recoups-73-of-hacked-funds-bolstering-crv-sentiment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">recovered over 70% of funds\u003C/a>, worth about $50 million.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Although the attack primarily targeted Curve Finance, its fallout underscores the risks inherent in the broader DeFi landscape. Despite being a relatively small hack in the crypto world, targeting only 4% of Curve's TVL, it demonstrates how vulnerabilities in a major interconnected DeFi protocol can affect others. It also highlights the challenges in auditing and maintaining diverse software and protocols, where a minor programming flaw can lead to multi-million-dollar losses. As the crypto industry and others digest what happened with Curve, this attack could potentially catalyze more stringent regulatory scrutiny on DeFi protocols, as governments and regulators continue to scrutinize the sector's operations.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Recommended reads\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Web3 and Crypto Capitals: A Global Perspective by Sandy Carter via Forbes\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The article investigates the explosive growth of Web3 and cryptocurrencies (nearly half a billion people worldwide own digital assets).
