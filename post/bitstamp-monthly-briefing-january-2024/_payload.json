Lending and borrowing products enable users to leverage their crypto holdings to access additional capital or earn rewards on assets they lend. While popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for years, these services are now increasingly available on centralized crypto platforms too.  \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />Understanding the basics is the first step to safely making the most of your crypto portfolio. \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />First, we examine how you can use your crypto holdings for access to more capital, or borrow, by exploring various forms of cryptocurrency loans:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Collateralized loans\u003C/strong>, the most common type, require users to deposit cryptocurrency as collateral, often involving overcollateralization. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio affects interest rate, and a lower LTV mitigates the risk of margin calls.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Crypto lines of credit\u003C/strong> are offering collateralized lines without predefined repayment terms. Users can borrow a specified percentage against their deposited collateral.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Uncollateralized loans\u003C/strong>, similar to personal loans, require an application, identity verification, and creditworthiness review\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Flash loans\u003C/strong> enable instant borrowing and repayment within a single transaction. These high-risk loans are favoured for exploiting market arbitrage opportunities, quickly capitalizing on price differences between markets.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Most loans feature instant approval since the borrowing terms are defined in a smart contract, and all transfers occur on-chain. It's important to note that borrowing crypto carries risks. Margin calls become a threat when the value of pledged collateral decreases, necessitating additional crypto deposits or risking asset liquidation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Deposited assets may often become illiquid due to varying withdrawal times across platforms.  Additionally, some borrowing options have high interest rates, often exceeding 5% APR and reaching up to 13% or more.  \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />Next, let's explore crypto lending, where cryptocurrency holders lend out their assets to earn rewards/generate yield. Think of this as putting your crypto to work to make more money, which is a perfect scenario if you intend to hold your crypto for a longer term. Crypto lending platforms and products typically cater to retail lenders on one side, lending crypto to larger market makers or institutional borrowers on the other. \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />This setup allows smaller retail lenders to earn rewards that can range from 2% APR to 6% or even more. The crypto lending platforms, however, can better manage risk as they are working with fewer large borrowers.  \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />Although crypto lending can vary in many details, such as restrictions on borrowers, length of the lending period or others, there are two main types of crypto lending:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Flexible lending \u003C/strong>offers no lock-in periods, meaning lenders can recall lending crypto anytime, thus providing greater liquidity freedom in portfolio management.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Stable lending \u003C/strong>features a pre-defined lock-in period, which lenders must agree to when lending their crypto holdings. Shorter lending periods often offer lower APR, but enable the lender to have more flexibility.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Like borrowing, crypto lending carries risks. To mitigate those risks, the lending platform can apply different measures such as ensuring proper due diligence on the borrowing entities, thoughtfully designing the terms of the borrowing agreements and requiring borrowers to fully or overcollateralize when borrowing.   \u003Cbr /> \u003Cbr />Trust and transparency are other important factors to consider when using lending products. At Bitstamp, we provide data and insights into lending product performance every month, with the Monthly Lending Performance Report. The report provides a comprehensive view of lending performance, including lending pool and yield performance, borrower risk profiles, collateral levels and leverage, portfolio concentration and risk profiles for each category of borrowers.
