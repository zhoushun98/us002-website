The \u003Ca href=\"https://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/SEC%20vs%20Ripple%207-13-23.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">ruling\u003C/a> directly responded to the SEC's claim that these actions constituted unregistered security sales.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The court's focus was not on the nature of the XRP token itself, but rather on how it was sold or distributed to counterparties. The ruling determined that transactions where investors did not expect profits from Ripple, such as blind sales on third-party platforms, and token distributions to employees and developers without monetary investment were not investment contracts under the Howey Test. However, the court did find that tokens sold directly to “sophisticated individuals and entities” should have been registered with the SEC.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The crypto markets responded positively to the news, with XRP's price surging by over 70%, and trading volumes reaching their highest levels since 2021.

Historically, precious metals like gold, prized for their physical allure and functional properties, have served as a favored form of hard money. However, the true value of gold is widely acknowledged to come from its scarcity and the challenging process of finding, extracting, and refining it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Since its inception in 2008, Bitcoin has garnered attention as a potential new form of hard money. Similar to gold mining, bitcoin mining demands substantial investments and energy as miners utilize immense computational power to solve complex mathematical problems and create new blockchain blocks. Consequently, advocates argue that bitcoin's scarcity and energy-intensive nature are central to its intrinsic value.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Certain proponents assert that Bitcoin offers a more dependable form of hard money than precious metals, largely due to its well-designed supply and demand structure. To explore this claim, let's consider a hypothetical scenario in which both gold and bitcoin experience an equivalent increase in prices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In the case of gold, rising prices incentivize miners to invest in their operations and expand their geographic reach, leading to increased gold output. However, the surplus supply saturates the market, causing price declines and a self-cannibalization effect when demand fails to match the increased supply.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Similarly, as the price of bitcoin increases, miners are also incentivized to expand their operations. However, the Bitcoin protocol incorporates a critical feature known as the 'difficulty-adjustment mechanism' to counter an excessive influx of new bitcoin into the market. This mechanism automatically increases the difficulty of the mathematical problems miners must solve as more computational energy enters the network, thereby maintaining a predefined release schedule (block confirmation time of approximately 10 minutes at the time of writing). According to proponents, the finite supply and difficulty adjustment make Bitcoin a superior store-of-value compared to precious metals and other commodities, addressing the self-cannibalization issue often observed in traditional commodities and further enhancing Bitcoin's value proposition.\u003C/p>\u003Cblockquote>BTC price and block confirmation time (minutes)\u003C/blockquote>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/08/btc-price-block-confirmation.png\" alt=\"btc price block confirmation time\" />\u003Cfigcaption>BTC Price and Block Confirmation time\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Source:\u003C/em>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/median-confirmation-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>BTC Price &amp; Confirmation Time\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Recommended reads\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Tether's and USD Coin's relationship with bitcoin's price by \u003Ca href=\"https://insights.santiment.net/read/tether-s-and-usd-coin-s-relationship-with-bitcoin-s-price-7338\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">@brianq\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The behavior of stablecoins, particularly Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), can provide useful insights into the direction of the overall crypto market.
