However, just two years later, Hong Kong has taken steps towards reclaiming its position as a prominent hub for cryptocurrency companies. Recognizing the importance of providing clear regulations for the crypto industry, Hong Kong introduced a comprehensive new regulatory framework in June that enables licensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) to offer retail crypto trading services.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This regulatory shift in Hong Kong comes amidst a global landscape where many crypto exchanges and service providers are actively seeking out jurisdictions with well-defined regulatory frameworks. In particular, crypto companies based in the United States have expressed frustration with the enforcement approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The recent SEC charges against \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-binance-in-us-district-court-for-unregistered-securities-operations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Binance\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-sues-coinbase-crypto-exchange\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Coinbase\u003C/a> for allegedly offering unregistered securities highlight these concerns.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Hong Kong's proactive regulatory actions demonstrate its ambition to regain its status as a leading destination for crypto companies. The VATP licensing framework establishes rigorous requirements encompassing consumer protections, market conduct, anti-money laundering (AML) measures, secure asset custody, and more. By prioritizing these safeguards, Hong Kong aims to establish itself as a safe and welcoming jurisdiction for crypto-related activities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>According to reports, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's banking regulator, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/15/hong-kong-put-pressure-on-three-major-banks-to-take-on-crypto-exchanges-as-clients-report/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">urged major banks\u003C/a> such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Bank of China to accept crypto exchanges as clients. This guidance is particularly noteworthy at a time when some banks in other regions have chosen to disassociate themselves or completely cut ties with crypto companies. In contrast, the HKMA emphasized the importance of supporting licensed crypto firms and recognizing their legitimate needs for bank accounts.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In June, a Hong Kong legislator \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Johnny_nkc/status/1667499874521350144?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">took to Twitter\u003C/a> to encourage crypto exchanges to establish their presence in Hong Kong, welcoming them to leverage the benefits of the new regulatory framework. These recent developments highlight the city's desire to create a favorable environment for crypto companies, backed by robust regulations and support from regulatory authorities.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>The race for a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US heats up\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Bitcoin experienced a price surge in June, reaching $31,000 multiple times during the second half of the month. This upward momentum was triggered by the news of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774923017574/bit20230608_s1.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">BlackRock's application\u003C/a> for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC. The announcement by the $9 trillion asset management giant had a domino effect, leading to a wave of other traditional financial institutions unveiling their own spot ETF products, in addition to various other crypto-related ventures.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Bitcoin price and TradFi announcements\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/07/btc-tradfi-announcements.png\" alt=\"bitcoin price tradfi announcements\" />\u003Cfigcaption>\u003Cstrong>Bitcoin price and TradFi announcements\u003C/strong>\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Source: \u003C/em>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITSTAMP%3ABTCUSD\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>BTC-USD intraday pricing data\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A Bitcoin ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is basically a mechanism that enables investing in Bitcoin without storing the keys for a Bitcoin wallet or signing up to a crypto exchange. Unlike the current trust offerings in the market, which rely on futures contracts to track Bitcoin's price, a spot ETF would enable financial institutions to directly buy or sell Bitcoin at the close of each trading day to align the fund's assets with its trading price.  This is an attractive prospect for investors as it would provide a more effective means of reflecting the crypto asset's underlying price, as well as allow for redemptions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>BlackRock's application marks at least the 33rd attempt to launch a BTC ETF in the US, as previous applications have consistently faced rejection by the SEC. Firms like Grayscale, Fidelity, Invesco, and Ark Investment have all sought approval for Bitcoin spot ETFs, only to be met with denials over concerns of alleged market manipulation, regulatory gaps, and fraud risks. However, the market's enthusiastic response to the recent announcements suggests renewed optimism for cryptocurrency spot ETF products, largely fueled by BlackRock's innovative product design.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In their application, BlackRock attempted to address the SEC's previous market integrity concerns by including a surveillance-sharing agreement (SSA) between Nasdaq and a crypto spot exchange. Through this agreement, trading activity, clearing activity, and customer identification information will be shared between the exchanges, aiming to mitigate the possibility of market manipulation. Following \u003Ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/146863/sec-calls-blackrock-fidelity-bitcoin-etf-applications-inadequate-wsj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">reports\u003C/a> that the SEC still deemed this approach to be inadequate, BlackRock and others have clarified their applications by \u003Ca href=\"https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">naming Coinbase\u003C/a> as a CEX partner.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Market confidence in BlackRock's application also stems from the firm's impressive track record in securing ETF approvals, boasting a ratio of 575 approvals to 1 rejection. This rate of success showcases BlackRock's proficiency in navigating the complex US regulatory landscape and further bolsters the optimism surrounding the potential approval of their Bitcoin ETF.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Recommended reads\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Banks, terribly designed stablecoins\u003C/strong> by \u003Ca href=\"https://panteracapital.com/blockchain-letter/banks-terribly-designed-stablecoins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Pantera Capital’s Dan Morehead\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Dan Morehead speaks with former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to discuss the role of banks and blockchain technology.
