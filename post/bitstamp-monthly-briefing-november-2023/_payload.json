The halving will reduce the rate at which new BTC are released into circulation by half. Many investors keenly look to halvings, because of their historical connection to market upswings, as do Bitcoin miners, who are reluctant to sell their BTC before the halving event, after which their mining rewards are slashed.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The growing institutionalization of crypto could also be indirectly influencing the recent increase in inactive Bitcoin. Inactive asset supply will increase with the growth of alternative investment instruments such as spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and cash-settled futures. For instance, with ETFs, issuers accumulate cryptocurrency and move it into custody, where it remains inactive. Nevertheless, investors can still engage in trading on an exchange through ETFs themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Interestingly, this Bitcoin halving is expected to coincide with the time when global economies are adjusting their monetary policies to control inflation and support economic stability. As Bitcoin enters its quantitative tightening phase, governments worldwide will be considering increasing their money supplies. If fiat currencies expand their supply while Bitcoin restricts its own, BTC investors may observe a unique divergence, which could potentially propel Bitcoin's price upward.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Blockchain exchanges\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Blockchain technology is transforming how financial services function. As blockchain enthusiasts explore the future possibilities of decentralization, examining past innovations and pivotal events that shaped the industry blockchain aims to revolutionize is intriguing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Until the 1960s, securities settlement relied solely on physical processes. When a stock or bond traded, a paper certificate had to be physically moved from seller to buyer by a courier through lower Manhattan. An increase in trading activity after 1965 flooded Wall Street with more trades than its brokerage houses could manually process, leading to the “paperwork crisis” of 1967. The crisis forced exchanges to close on Wednesdays, shorten trading hours on other days, and extend settlement to T+5 — all to allow brokerages to work through their backlog of unsettled trades.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The back-office crisis led to considerable disorder, with reports indicating that approximately $400 million in securities went missing, stolen, or potentially lost, in the chaos. The crisis only began to ease during the bear market of 1969 when trading activity decreased to a more manageable level. However, the damage was done, and in subsequent years many investors moved to take control and self-custody their security certificates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The lasting impact of the paperwork crisis is reflected in the current state of Wall Street. Computerization, the advent of NASDAQ, centralized clearing, and the emergence of large brokerages, all directly stem from the back-office turmoil of 1968.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This brief history of traditional finance (TradFi) development paves the way for understanding the emergence of blockchain technology. A recent paper, \u003Ca href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=376121095093094111003092029101006123096024026051006017127100014071122083006126019028042012019003037044061067070006088117125064013080022030086117078023099105005122072065065011103125023019120088083010099090003127124005002070090073000068090118123097112114&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Electronification, trading, and crypto\u003C/a>, demonstrates how blockchain technology can extend and improve the mission to make markets more efficient and transparent. For example, permissionless blockchains now enable new structures not previously possible with the traditional trading stack: the entire trading stack merges into a single, cohesive system, agnostic to participants.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This infrastructure comprises various components: the network, consisting of nodes facilitating communication through blockchain protocols; custody and settlement, involving tokens representing digital assets transferable among users and held in custody by both users and smart contracts; coordination and process, where the blockchain protocol serves as the foundational layer for communication and coordination, complemented by the smart contract protocol executing the business logic of the exchange mechanism; and price discovery, achieved through a straightforward formula, leveraging smart contract logic and token pools within them. Thanks to the publicly accessible trading infrastructure, which requires no single entity's ownership or control, anyone can create a market for any asset.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Looking to the past, the market structure shifts enabled by blockchains have the potential to continue to revolutionize financial services and better serve market participants. Yet, the widespread impact and long-term success of blockchains hinge significantly on mainstream adoption and the regulatory climate surrounding these innovative technologies.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>Recommended reads\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Interview with Domo, the Ordinals creator by \u003C/strong>\u003Ca href=\"https://pageone.gg/p/brc-20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cstrong>Boffin\u003C/strong>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The article dives into the creation and impact of the BRC-20 token standard by its creator, Domo.
