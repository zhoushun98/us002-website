This year's conference was nothing short of energetic and intense, and we can't wait to provide you with a glimpse into the insights, trends, and excitement we encountered.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Token 2049 was hosted in the vibrant heart of Asia's crypto hub, Singapore, reaffirming its status as the continent's premier crypto event. At the event, we witnessed a dynamic ecosystem where innovation thrives, bringing together a diverse community of builders, venture investors, and traders. It was a week filled with non-stop learning, networking, and excitement, amplifying the energy and intensity of the event.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/10/bitstamp-event-outside.png\" alt=\"Bitstamp at Token2049 \" />\u003Cfigcaption>\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>Bitstamp at Token2049\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Some of the top topics that resonated during the conference included the growing regulatory frameworks across the APAC region, seen as critical for future growth, and the strategy of building in a bear market to better position for future bull markets garnered substantial attention.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Over the next 12 months, our peers in the industry were particularly excited to follow three major trends: the development of the stablecoin market, the emergence of the next wave of engaging P2E games, and efforts to address the debanking challenges in the industry, focusing on banking partnerships and on/off ramps.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This year's Token 2049 felt notably distinct from previous editions. It was much larger, featuring a higher quality of projects at the exhibition booths. The event saw a shift towards a more institutional crowd, aligning with its intended audience. The speaker lineup was exceptionally strong, featuring industry leaders from across the ecosystem. Perhaps the most significant impact on our perspective towards the industry was the emphasis on the need for collective collaboration efforts to drive the industry forward.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As we reflect on our time at Token 2049, we're excited to share these insights and inspirations. The energy, intensity, and sense of collaboration at the event have ignited our passion for innovation in the crypto space.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>The Utility Case for Stablecoins\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>The emergence of stablecoins calls back to the origins of eurodollars in the 1950s, as was pointed out by Nic Carter at the recent \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD2Au5JwhZ0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Token2049 event\u003C/a>. Eurodollars are USD-denominated liabilities of a bank located outside the US. Eurodollars originated from the swift post-war growth of European exports to the US, developing as a response to US banking market restrictions while maintaining a desire for global USD transactions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As mentioned above, the emerging stablecoin industry reflects some noteworthy characteristics of eurodollars. For example, the majority of USD stablecoins are issued offshore (ca. 75%), they allow users to bypass the need for a banking middleman, and they offer a more flexible form of capital for a globalized market. Furthermore, the stablecoin market is overwhelmingly dollarized, with USD-denominated stablecoins representing ca. 99% of all stablecoin supply.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Stablecoins are systemically important in cryptocurrency markets. While they may represent only ca. 10% of the entire crypto market cap, they constitute \u003Ca href=\"https://research.kaiko.com/insights/the-state-of-stablecoins\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">74% of all cryptocurrency transactions\u003C/a> on centralized exchanges, i.e., most of the crypto activity incorporates stablecoins, not fiat. However, the stablecoin supply has been slowly reducing during the duration of the bear market.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure>\u003Cimg src=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/bts-img/2023/10/stablecoin-market-cap-eur-usd.png\" alt=\"stablecoin market cap eur-usd\" />\u003Cfigcaption>Stablecoin market cap EUR &amp; USD\u003C/figcaption>\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Source: \u003Ca href=\"https://defillama.com/stablecoins?backing=FIATSTABLES\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>DefiLlama\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The demand for quicker and cheaper movement of capital has also been recognized by non-crypto native firms. The latest addition to the USD-backed stablecoin roster is payment processing giant PayPal, with its PayPal USD or PYUSD. PYUSD hit the market at the end of August 2023 and was also recently \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/markets/pyusd/usd/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">listed on Bitstamp\u003C/a>. PayPal aims to ease in-house transactions for its users and provide them with an alternative payment method for purchasing goods and services.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Looking to the future, the recent popularity of non-USD stablecoins also showcases stablecoins’ utility in FX markets and global remittance, to beat the slow pace and high costs of the global remittance corridors, which were \u003Ca href=\"https://www.knomad.org/sites/default/files/publication-doc/migration_development_brief_38_june_2023_0.pdf#page=9\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">estimated at $831 billion\u003C/a> in 2022.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Recommended reads\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Emerging Catalysts in Crypto – the Industry’s Parallels to Maturity in Equities by \u003C/strong>\u003Ca href=\"https://panteracapital.com/blockchain-letter/emerging-catalysts-in-crypto/#:~:text=CRYPTO%20INDUSTRY%20PARALLELS%20TO%20MATURITY%20IN%20EQUITIES\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">\u003Cstrong>Pantera\u003C/strong>\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tokens are emerging as a new form of capital formation and may replace traditional equity for businesses, meaning companies may just have a token instead of stock exchange listed equity.
