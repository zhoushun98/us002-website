Explore the alignment with Bitstamp's custodial objectives and the importance of shared values.","\u003Cp>In today's rapidly evolving and diverse crypto landscape, the need for strategic partnerships is more paramount than ever. How so? As industry requirements and regulations become more complex, businesses are finding it challenging to handle everything in-house. To tackle this, key functions are now moving towards a more specialized and independent approach. This means businesses need to collaborate with the right partners who can provide efficient solutions that ensure both reliability​​ and security.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At Bitstamp, we strongly believe that the future of crypto will be shaped by clear regulatory frameworks. After all, regulation provides market participants with protection against bad actors which translates to trust and stability. Also, we understand the significance of partnerships and shared aspirations towards common goals and have been, to this end, forging a strong alliance with BitGo, a trusted name in custody services, since 2019. As two of the longest-running companies in the crypto industry, Bitstamp, founded in 2011, and BitGo, founded in 2013, bring to the table a wealth of experience and operational excellence.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let’s explore how this partnership aligns with the high standards that Bitstamp has set for its custody arrangement and the importance of shared values in delivering a well-rounded solution to our valued clients.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>The Importance of Custody in Crypto\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Custodians serve as guardians, ensuring the safekeeping and security of valuable digital assets on behalf of individuals and institutions.

We also recognize that providing ​a ​best-in-class custody setup requires specialized expertise and risk diversification. So, instead of relying solely on internal resources, we have chosen to collaborate with trusted third-party custodians, forming a strategic alliance based on shared philosophy and a proven track record.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, what does Bitstamp, as one of the most regulated crypto exchanges in the industry, search for in terms of asset custody?\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>The Synergy with BitGo\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>With security and reliable trade execution as our priorities, we, as a rule, use industry leading technology in every aspect of our operations, and strive to offer \u003Ca href=\"https://blog.bitstamp.net/post/why-would-a-crypto-exchange-have-bank-grade-custody/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bank-grade custody to our users\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Therefore, we have chosen a regulated qualified custodian to protect ​your ​assets​​, bringing additional rigor and assurance to the security ​package​​.
