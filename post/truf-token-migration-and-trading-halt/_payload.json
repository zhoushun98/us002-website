","\u003Cp>Recently, TRUF experienced a security breach, and the Truflation team is now taking steps to protect the integrity of their ecosystem, including changing the token addresses. In line with our commitment to security and customer protection, we’ve proactively halted all deposits, withdrawals, and trading for TRUF/USD and TRUF/EUR pairs as of October 30, 2024. This will help ensure a safe, smooth transition as TRUF implements all necessary changes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The TRUF team took a snapshot of all TRUF token balances on October 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM UTC. If you held TRUF on Bitstamp at that time, you’ll automatically get the new TRUF token later this quarter (Q4).
