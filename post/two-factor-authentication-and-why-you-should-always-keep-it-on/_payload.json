It achieves this by requiring that you confirm critical account actions, such as logging in or withdrawing funds, using a second device. For example, if you log in on your desktop computer, 2FA demands that you confirm the login on a different device, like your mobile phone.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>Why is 2FA so effective?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If you use a strong password, change it regularly and keep all devices used to log in to your account safe at all times, the risk of anyone getting access to your account is minimal. But it is never zero. 2FA goes a long way to decrease this risk even further.\u003Cbr />\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With 2FA activated, not only would someone trying to enter your account have to learn your password and gain access to a device commonly used to log in to your account, they would also have to get their hands on the device you use for 2FA. And that makes the whole affair much more difficult.\u003Cbr />\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If someone tried to log into your Bitstamp account on your personal computer, they wouldn’t be able to get in without a confirmation code that is only generated on your mobile phone, which would ideally be safely stored in your pocket.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3>How can I enable 2FA at Bitstamp?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>To start using 2FA, you need to set it up while registering your account or enable it later in the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.bitstamp.net/settings/security/two-factor-authentication/\">Two-factor authentication\u003C/a> submenu of your account.
