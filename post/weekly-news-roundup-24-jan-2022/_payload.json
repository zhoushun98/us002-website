Twitter Blue, the social media platform's subscription service, rolled out the feature Thursday with a splashy introduction video and \u003Ca href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">step-by-step explainer page\u003C/a>.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>According to the announcements, Twitter's profile picture feature is being powered by the API of NFT marketplace OpenSea. Supported wallets are Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, Rainbow, Argent, Trust and Ledger Live.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\"Setting up an NFT profile picture means people can associate your Twitter account with your connected wallet’s public crypto wallet address,\" Twitter said on its explainer page. \"This means your Twitter account will be associated with your current and historical crypto wallet transactions and holdings, including all other NFTs in that wallet, because this information is all available on the public blockchain.\"\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Twitter stressed that it will never seek funds from or access to a user's wallet, cautioning about potential scammers who may attempt to do so.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>At present, the feature is limited to those on the iOS mobile platform. \"Right now subscribers can only set an NFT as their profile picture from the Twitter for iOS app, but the hexa-shaped profile picture is seen across all platforms,\" said Twitter.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The move is a significant development for the platform's crypto-related ambitions, which last September enabled bitcoin tipping via the Lightning Network. The company also offered details about its internal NFT projects as well. In practice, a Twitter account with the NFT profile picture feature enabled displays an array of information about the NFT in question, including its creator, specific properties and characteristics, network (like Ethereum) and which token standard was used to deploy it, among other details.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/131052/twitter-begins-rolling-out-access-to-nft-profile-pictures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/131052/twitter-begins-rolling-out-access-to-nft-profile-pictures\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>20.01.2022\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Chr />\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Intel Is Apparently Making a Bitcoin-Mining Chip to Save GPUs for Gamers\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>The chipmaker looks set to release a purpose-built chip for mining bitcoin next month.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Crypto mining is loathed by gamers and anyone who cares about the environment, but that isn’t stopping Intel from getting into the bitcoin-harvesting business.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>While the chipmaker hasn’t said anything publicly just yet, eagle-eyed reporters at Tom’s Hardware noticed that Team Blue is set to give a presentation about a new “Bonanza Mine” processor at the 2022 International Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC), which kicks off on Feb. 20. The chip is described as an “ultra-low-voltage energy-efficient bitcoin-mining ASIC,” where the acronym stands for an application-specific integrated circuit—a chip made for one specific purpose.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Intel had, in a way, already teased this chip last year when GPU chief Raja Koduri stated in a live stream that the company was working on specialized crypto-mining hardware. And as Tom’s Hardware points out, Intel had previously filed a patent for a processing system using SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function used by several cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, for verifying transactions.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>If Intel does indeed release its own crypto-mining chip, it will be in direct competition with Bitmain, a Chinese company that specializes in making ASICs for mining bitcoin. But Intel isn’t starting from scratch—its SHA-256 Extensions are supported on Ice Lake processors and later, and as we all know, the company has extensive experience optimizing silicon.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>This is obviously good news for bitcoin miners, but what about gamers? If we dig into Koduri’s comments a bit deeper, he suggests that discrete graphics for gaming should be separate from processing chips made exclusively for crypto mining.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://gizmodo.com/intel-is-apparently-making-a-bitcoin-mining-chip-to-sav-1848378634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://gizmodo.com/intel-is-apparently-making-a-bitcoin-mining-chip-to-sav-1848378634\u003C/a>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>18.01.2022\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Chr />\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>USDC's supply on Ethereum surpasses that of rival USDT's for the first time\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>The total supply of the USDC stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain has surpassed that of rival Tether's (USDT) for the first time.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The current total supply of USDC on Ethereum stands at 39.92 billion, whereas USDT's total supply on the blockchain stands at 39.82 billion, according to Etherscan.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>USDC's supply beating USDT's on Ethereum is significant since the blockchain remains a major contributor of growth for both stablecoins.

Meta's digital currency wallet Novi is also said to be a key component in its push into NFTs.
