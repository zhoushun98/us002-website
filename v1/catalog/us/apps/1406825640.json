Using both the app and the website often I will say it’s frustrating that so much functionality is lost between the two. Some customization for your indicators on app would be great because dark mode is your enemy since you can’t change indie colors and dark blue for keltner channels makes them impossible to see.\n\nAlso when trying to look at specific bar volume with your finger on the chart not being able to just move your finger to check certain price levels and such is frustrating, the entire chart moves rendering the feature useless.\n\nThis is my main crypto exchange, it is far superior to coinbase pro even with the lack of customization but I would still love to see these improvements over time.\n\nThank you for reading, use this app, that is all.","rating":4,"isEdited":false,"userName":"B-Rock90","title":"Love the app, some suggestions"}},{"id":"6356193540","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2020-08-24T16:08:06Z","developerResponse":{"id":17458207,"body":"Our KYC procedures are conducted with the intention to continue providing a safe and stable trading environment, as well as protect our clients from being exposed to risks associated with money laundering and all sorts of scams. \r\n\nOur agent will gladly assist you if you reply to the ongoing ticket.","modified":"2020-08-24T08:58:40Z"},"review":"Quite simply these people can decide to keep your money whenever they please- they have no conscience no compassion and I had used the service without trouble for many years.

Please research high amount of withdrawal complaints prior to performing KYC. I made the mistake and didn’t research anything about this exchange and I regret it. Luckily my loss was minimum but it’s still my money I cannot withdraw. These reviews are to assist people in the good and bad experiences dealing with companies. It’s just not an app but a company behind the app. Bitstamp do offer phone support but resolution is none existent. Yeah I can call but it doesn’t do any good a lot of other people stated this fact. Email support is like a lot of other exchanges very slow and they get it wrong or just stop responding. Personally I think these reviews should alert Apple and they need to investigate Bitstamp for accountability. Again, make sure people that you slow down and take your time to research.","rating":1,"isEdited":true,"title":"Do NOT Open Account","userName":"Carbonbreath"}},{"id":"6851230512","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2021-01-10T01:06:43Z","developerResponse":{"id":20315602,"body":"Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIn regards to XRP, we're closely monitoring the unfolding situation and we'll continue to respond accordingly.","modified":"2021-01-11T11:34:54Z"},"review":"Positive things first: Their charts for the mobile app are easier to read than most of the bigger players out there like Coinbase and Uphold. Their fiat ramp is quick and the KYC process is expedient. Up until now I’ve enjoyed their trading experience overall. \n\nNegative aspects: They have a poor selection of alt coins from which to choose. BUT they exchange 2 stable coins and BTC and... up until now XRP. Sadly, they lack the fortitude to continue carrying the 3rd/4th largest alt coin due to the recent lawsuit alleged by the SEC. While it carries no legal ramifications to exchange XRP during this time period, and the outcome of the SEC-XRP struggle will effect all cryptocurrency, not just XRP, it shows Bitstamp has no backbone to stand behind it’s customers. So for now, I will be taking my business to Uphold, Bianance and Coinbase Pro.","rating":3,"isEdited":false,"userName":"fargo family","title":"Lack of Leadership"}},{"id":"11099115755","type":"user-reviews","attributes":{"date":"2024-03-29T16:15:57Z","developerResponse":{"id":44993786,"body":"We're very sorry to hear about your experience, but happy to hear the issue was resolved in the end.

Froze my account and continually gave me no reason why I could not pull my money out citing, “ongoing internal procedures”. I provided all documentation and asked everyday if anything else was needed, but was just given no specific reason. Even if they gave me some sort of reason or specific type of internal process they were running, I would have been understanding.  I think they were just holding my money for 30 days because on the 30th day exactly, my money was released. Month is a long time in my opinion. Closed my account and moved my money over to eToro.

Ok, so what’s the other option? Oh, that’s a wire transfer that also charges a $25 fee to transfer. Ok...so, how long does that take? 2-7 days. This app and their policies are SO misleading!
